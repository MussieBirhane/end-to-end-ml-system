        "1.2 Digital transformation of seismic engineering\n",
        "In recent years, most engineering sectors have been impacted and benefited from new tools and technologies. Digital transformation, positively linked with productivity, has changed how engineers operate and make decisions. However, digital transformation evolution in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry has been slow compared to other engineering industries sectors, such as mechanical, electrical, electronic, and manufacturing workflow[6], [7]. It is now more critical than ever that the AEC industry equip itself and benefit from the right technologies for sustainable growth.\n",
        "At this time, artificial intelligence is one of the fastest-growing emerging technologies and describes machines that can perform tasks that previously required human intelligence. Many tasks engineers are responsible for, such as design and simulation, can be enhanced with the support of artificial intelligence tools.\n",
        "Machine learning (ML) takes it a step further. It is one of the latest artificial intelligence technologies where in recent years, advanced ML algorithms have been successfully applied to many areas of engineering. Their success is assumed from the detailed processing of data that captures the system behaviour. By detecting patterns in the collected data, valuable information can be extracted, and reliable predictions can be made that automate the decision-making process. That fact introduces ML as an advanced tool in modern engineering. ML technologies could be a promising solution to overcome the complexity of nonlinear structural modelling and time- consuming analysis.\n",
        "10\n",
        "Accordingly, many theoretical studies have been done, studying the use of ML for predicting nonlinear seismic responses.

According to most of the articles and our previous discussision, I am proceeding with the vector database approach (which seems the most elegant approach to tackle the problem btw).

Utilising new technologies including the internet of\\nthings (IoT) and digital twin (DT) can signiﬁcantly reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs. An\\ninfrastructure DT involves its digital replica and must include data on geometric, geospatial reference,\\nperformance, attributes (material, environment etc.) and management. Then, the acquired data need\\nto be analysed and visualised to inform maintenance decision making. To develop this DT, the ﬁrst\\nstep is the study of the infrastructure life cycle to design DT architecture. Using data semantics,\\nthis paper presents a novel DT architecture design for an intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nsystem. Semantic modelling is used as a powerful tool to structure and organize data. This approach\\nprovides an industry context through capturing knowledge about infrastructures in the structure of\\nsemantic model graph. Using new technologies, DT approach derives and presents meaningful data\\non infrastructure real-time performance and maintenance requirements, and in a more expressible\\nand interpretable manner. The data semantic model will guide when and what data to collect for\\nfeeding into the infrastructure DT. The proposed DT concept was applied on one of the conveyors\\nof Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal in Queensland Australia to monitor the structural performance in\\nreal-time, which enables predictive maintenance to avoid breakdowns and disruptions in operation\\nand consequential ﬁnancial impacts.\\nKeywords: digital twin; internet of things; architecture design; data semantic modelling; intelligent\\ninfrastructure maintenance\\n1. Introduction\\nIncreasing utilisation and aging infrastructure has resulted in the requirement for\\ninfrastructure assets continuous health monitoring [1].\\nThere are about 22,500 bridges in Australia with a replacement cost of around AUD\\n3 billion , and an annual maintenance expenditure of about AUD 300 million [ 2]. The United\\nStates Federal Highway Administration incurs a bi-annual inspection cost of AUD 3.4 billion\\nwhere the average inspection cost for each bridge structure is AUD 5500 to 12,500.\\nThe architecture, engineering and construction industries combined worldwide an-\\nnual expenditure is more than AUD 10 trillion. These industries are globally the largest\\nconsumers of raw material, and their built assets are responsible for 25 to 40% of the world’s\\ntotal carbon emissions [ 3]. Furthermore, according to the World Bank, demand for civil\\ninfrastructure exceeds supply at a shortfall of AUD one trillion every year [3].\\nA total of 65% to 85% of the facility management cost is spent for their maintenance\\nand yet there is not an efﬁcient management and decision making strategy to optimise\\nthis cost [ 4]. In facility maintenance management, there are two main issues with existing\\nfacility management systems [4]:\\n\\x0f inability of computerised maintenance management systems or, in other words, facility\\nmanagement systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148664 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 2 of 25\\n\\x0f difﬁculty in accessing accurate information for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of\\nalmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures, utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspections\\n(level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and process\\nthe acquired data.

Overview of existing maintenance processes . \\nProblems of existing maintenance processes: \\n• Data exchange: One of the costly shortcomin gs of the existing processes is data ex-\\nchange during inspection planning, implementation and reporting, as most likely \\neach of these phases is conducted by a diff erent party (i.e., planners, inspectors, main-\\ntainers).

Cur-\\nrently produced digital data are in differ ent formats and not necessarily compatible \\nbetween different software, which makes thei r lifespan limited and with little guar-\\nantee that the data will make it to later stages of asset utilisation. According to Smith \\nand Domer [3], the model-based applicatio n outputs’ interoperability challenges \\ncosts the U.S. facility owners USD 15.8 billion as a result of lost efficiency.

Notwithstanding this, the objectives of monitor-\\ning practices have similarities in working towards more precision in detecting damages,\\nstraightforward management, data storage, timeliness and reliability of the collected infor-\\nmation [ 6]. An international standard framework for data exchange is the ISO 15926 . Due\\nto not being speciﬁc for practical utilisation, many different specialisations of this standard\\nhave been derived without much alignment between them. There is not a universal dataSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 3 of 25\\nmodel for conducting infrastructure inspections, identifying defects, or determining main-\\ntenance strategies which can avoid inconsistencies and inefﬁciencies. Furthermore, existing\\ndata exchange or transfer practices along different lifecycle phases (i.e., construction, plan-\\nning and implementing inspection, executing maintenance strategies, monitoring) could\\nresult in data loss and re-works due to inefﬁcient practices and interoperability difﬁculties\\nbetween the utilised technologies. Recent advances, such as unmanned aerial photography,\\nhas already resulted in reducing the risk of data loss and error. Though, even with this\\nadvancement, the problem of data loss while digitising the obtained analogue information\\nstill exists and retaining the lost data is costly and time consuming [7]. Another challenge\\nis ever increasing amounts of collected data, which needs to be stored and processed to\\nmake informed decisions about infrastructure maintenance as the existing practices do not\\nhave the capacity to keep up with the demand (due to scale of telemetry data and rapid\\ngrowth of systems and existing approaches, whose reliance on operators to detect and\\ncorrect anomalies in the systems is impractical [8]).\\nFollowing are different maintenance strategies based on the intervention time:\\n\\x0f Reactive (ﬁreﬁghting/corrective) also known as failure-based.\\n\\x0f Preventative—also known as time-based. DT approach (further explained in Section 4)\\ncan be utilised in preventative strategies to predict the state of an asset and therefore\\nreduce the number of unnecessary preventative maintenance activities providing\\nlonger time intervals between them.\\n\\x0f Condition-based (based on asset condition)—also known as diagnosis-based mainte-\\nnance (efﬁcient detection of anomalies in the existing condition of an asset and fast\\ndata processing is made possible thanks to the developed state of technologies such\\nas IOT and cloud computing [ 9]). Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can enhance this\\nmaintenance approach in diagnosing and acquiring detailed status data [10].\\n\\x0f Predictive (prognosis)—this approach can use a data driven (data driven techniques\\n(clustering, neural networks, Bayesian networks, support vector machine (SVM) and\\nprincipal components analysis (PCA)) are data-oriented, which can be obtained with\\nappropriate sensor deployment) or model driven (the model driven technique uses\\nmathematical methods (analytical, physical, or numerical models) to describe an asset)\\ntechnique to predict maintenance.\\nThe main process of maintenance prediction is prognosis. Predictive maintenance is one\\nof intensively investigated subjects in the industry 4.0 movement [ 10]. Industry 4.0 (the 4th\\nindustrial revolution after steam engine, assembly line and automation) combines existing\\ntechnologies within the industry with new IT and communication (IoT) technologies [ 11].\\nIndustry 4.0 is bridging the cyber and physical worlds and its ultimate goal is to digitalise\\nmodern systems [12]. Figure 2 illustrates industry evolution from the beginning to now.\\nPredictive maintenance reduces both maintenance planning and implementation in\\ndomains of time and cost by 5 to 10 and 20 to 50%, respectively [9].\\n\\x0f Prescriptive (knowledge-based) maintenance—in addition to predicting the status\\nof the asset this approach aims to optimise maintenance via prescribing action to\\nmaintain an asset by using historical and real-time data.\\nTriggered by industry and technology evolution, structural health monitoring (SHM)\\nhas been introduced as a new branch of civil engineering which focuses on assessing the\\ncivil infrastructure health status [ 13].

This integration has two modules including\\ndata acquisition and storage using automated sensors and a data modelling/visualisation,\\nwhich interprets sensor data to identify anomalies and damages in the structure. The BIM\\nmodel highlights damaged elements using colour coding, which is based on predeﬁned\\nthreshold values [ 16]. Existing BIM-based approaches, especially the Industry Foundation\\nClasses (IFC) standard, only focus on describing sensor related information, and further\\naspects of SHM related information, such as real-time data processing and analysis, are not\\ncovered [15].\\nFeng and Feng [ 17] offered non-contact vision-based sensor systems for SHM due to\\ntheir ﬂexibility in extracting structural displacements at multiple locations. Their study\\naimed to link measured displacements to the quantiﬁcation of structural health condition\\nthrough validating feasible simultaneous identiﬁcation of the stiffness of structures and\\nunknown excitation forces in the time domain. Results of the laboratory experiment on a\\nsmall scall beam revealed that displacement measurements at two points along the beam\\ncan identify the global stiffness as well as external hammer excitation forces.\\nIn another study, metal packaged optical ﬁbre strain sensors were utilised to instru-\\nment selected reinforcement bars in a wind turbine foundation before concrete casting.\\nThe measured foundation strains showed a high extent correlation with measured tower\\ndisplacements as well as the foundation ﬁnite element model (FEM) analysis [ 18]. Fur-Sustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 5 of 25\\nthermore, in the last few decades, improvements in the ﬁeld of smart sensing systems,\\nwhich results in enabling event-triggered (real-time) high ﬁdelity data acquisition when\\nstrong ground motion events occur, and emerging signal processing techniques has led to\\nconsiderable growth of seismic SHM [19].\\nA computer vision based non-destructive SHM method encompassing a digital high\\nspeed imaging system combined with artiﬁcial intelligence for detecting civil structures’\\ndynamic vibrations has been proposed by [ 1]. Their research claims to provide factual\\ninformation regarding the location and displacement amount of an existing fracture in\\na civil structure. An artiﬁcial neural network was also utilised in their study to infer\\nqualitative characteristics of the vibrations within the structure based on their intensity.\\nGlobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and Earth observation (EO) technologies\\nhave been attempted in a study by the University of Nottingham for SHM of a long span\\nbridge [ 13]. The initial results have shown signiﬁcant potential of the technologies and\\ntherefore the project was further extended to the demonstration stage where two long span\\nbridges in China were considered as test structures.\\nThree dimensional digital image correlation systems have proved their ability to\\nprovide reliable objective information of structural changes, strain and geometric proﬁles\\nof large structures [ 20]. Unmanned aerial vehicles technique have been combined with\\nthree dimensional digital image correlation by Reagan et al. [ 20] to monitor the structural\\nhealth of concrete infrastructures.\\nDT technology has recently gained momentum in being investigated for utilisation in\\nintelligent asset management. Infrastructure DT is the digital replica of an infrastructure\\nwhich enables simulation of its real-time performance. DT encompasses three aspects:\\nphysical object, its digital replica, and the communication channel between the two. DT\\ntechnology incorporates beneﬁts of most of the methods which have previously been\\nutilised for SHM including:\\n\\x0f BIM—to visualise the infrastructure performance\\n\\x0f sensors—to collect real-time data and\\n\\x0f structural analysis methods—to simulate and study structural performance (e.g., ﬁnite\\nelement analysis (FEA), which is a simulation method to objectively deﬁne and predict\\nthe performance of infrastructures)\\nDT has been researched in the SHM of spacecraft structures by Shangguan et al. [ 8],\\nsmall-scale knuckle boom crane by Moi et al. [ 21], and collapse fragility assessment of long\\nspan bridges under strong earthquakes by Lin et al. [22].\\nIn the next sections the terminologies and steps in developing DT architecture design\\nfor infrastructure SHM and its application on a port structure will be explained.\\n3. DT and Intelligent Infrastructure Maintenance\\nAccording to the literature, DT (in its current concept) was first proposed by Prof. Michael\\nGreives at the University of Michigan in 2002 [23]. Since then, the DT concept has evolved.\\nRosen et al. [ 24] introduced the DT concept as two identical physical and virtual spaces\\nwhich allow mirroring between them to analyse the conditions that they experience in\\ndifferent phases of the object’s lifecycle. Then, Boschert and Rosen [ 25] detailed that a DT\\nencompasses all the potential useful physical and functional information from a physical\\nobject/system/process. Furthermore, Boschert and Rosen [ 25] agree that DT not only is\\nformed by data but also algorithms that explain behaviours to make decisions. Grieves\\nand Vickers [ 26] deﬁned DT as: a physical product in a real space, virtual product in a\\nvirtual space and the connection of data, which ties the two together. The information\\nthey were referring to was a set of information that provides a comprehensive description\\nof a real object including from its most general geometry to its most concrete behaviour.\\nFurthermore, according to Smart Cities Council of Australia and New Zealand, a digital\\ntwin must include data sets including geometric and graphical data, geospatial reference\\ndata, attributes (semantics) of the material, and performance and management data [27].Sustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 6 of 25\\nThe concept of using DT dates back to NASA’s Apollo program where two identical\\nspacecrafts/vehicles were manufactured to not only allow engineers to mirror the perfor-\\nmance of the space vehicle during the mission by monitoring the twin vehicle remaining\\non earth but also be used for training during ﬂight preparation [25].\\nThe U.S. Air Force also published the idea of establishing the concept of DT as being\\npart of their long-term vision. Their idea was to have a DT of every airplane with all\\ndeviations from its nominal design. Iron bird is another example of a twin in the form of\\nhardware. Iron bird is an engineering tool in the aircraft industry which is ground based and\\nis tasked to incorporate, optimise, and validate vital aircraft systems. The iron bird enables\\nengineers to validate characteristics of components of the system and discover anomalies\\nand incompatibilities that may need to be modiﬁed at early development stages. Iron\\nbird capabilities goes even further and allows engineers to study and analyse effects and\\ntreatments of failures. Improvements in the simulation technologies allow the engineers to\\nutilise the concept of iron bird but replace the hardware parts with virtual models even\\nbefore the physical parts are built.\\nSimulation and modelling are nowadays a standard process to support designing\\nor validating system properties. To describe all the disciplines in a system—both sepa-\\nrately and in combination with other disciplines—simulation models are needed and only\\nsimulation models will enable the mastering of the extended challenges resulting from\\nnew technologies, which are used in all kinds of systems [ 25]. Classical goals, which are\\npursued from simulation, are to reduce development time/time-to-market, reduce the cost\\nof developing a system/product, and meeting quality and client requirements. As can be\\nseen in Figure 3, recently, simulation has evolved from being a technology restricted to com-\\nputer experts and mathematicians to a standard tool for engineers to simulate speculated\\nscenarios in developing engineering designs.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 26 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.

DT Application in Improving Maintenance Practices\\nDT is a smart way to collect all essential information about an asset in one place\\nand beneﬁt from improved consistency and seamless development processes at early\\nstages and re-use of collected data for maintenance decision making at later lifecycle\\nstages [ 25]. Maintenance is one of the most researched lifecycle phases of different indus-\\ntries. Errandonea et al. [10] conducted a review on the application of DT in maintenance\\nwithin different industries. Their review included a total of 167 results, which included\\njournal and conference articles, book chapters, reviews, and business articles. According to\\ntheir review, the manufacturing industry is the number one ﬁeld with the highest amount\\nof research on implementing DT followed by industries with offshore infrastructure, such\\nas oil and gas and wind turbines. In a study conducted by Wang et al. [ 29] on the DT related\\npatents, they also concluded most of the DT-related patents appear in the manufacturing\\nindustry. Construction (buildings and bridges) and aeronautics are in third place in the\\nresearch on the application of DT.\\nDT have been previously used to partially improve maintenance strategies, for example\\nmaintenance planning by Hlady et al. [ 30], fault detection and diagnosis by Barbosa et al. [ 31],\\ncalculating maintenance cost by Kaewunruen and Xu [32], or helping operators in performing\\nspecific maintenance tasks by Pairet et al. [ 33]; Rødseth et al. [ 34]; Longo et al. [ 35]; V enables [ 36];\\nOmer et al. [37]; and Anderson et al. [38].\\nAs mentioned in Section 1, there are ﬁve different maintenance strategies including\\nreactive, preventative, condition based, predictive and prescriptive depending on interven-\\ntion time. Reactive maintenance does not need to utilise an expensive technology, such as\\nDT, as a reactive strategy consists of repairing an asset or a component when it fails.\\nDT has application in preventative maintenance strategies to predict the state of\\ninfrastructure and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary preventative maintenance\\nactivities providing longer time intervals between them.\\nFurthermore, condition-based maintenance, or the detection of anomalies in the exist-\\ning condition of an infrastructure, is made possible thanks to the advanced technologies,\\nsuch as IoT and cloud computing. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms can enhance this\\nmaintenance approach in diagnosing and acquiring detailed status data.\\nAs previously stated in Section 1, predictive and prescriptive strategies offer the high-\\nest potential in existing digitisation trends and can use a data or model driven techniques\\nto predict maintenance.\\nSo far, only condition-based, and predictive maintenance strategies have been re-\\nsearched in the construction industry and no paper is found in prescriptive maintenance\\nstrategy in the construction industry as far as our review of the literature is concerned.\\n3.2. Roadblocks, Alternatives and Research Questions\\nThe roadblocks in evolving from basic maintenance strategies to more advanced\\nstrategies using a DT technology includes:\\n\\x0f A detailed maintenance procedure to structure the processes\\n\\x0f Data availability, integrity, security, and quality\\n\\x0f Regulatory barriers (regulatory bodies have a timely process in adopting new technologies)Sustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 9 of 25\\n\\x0f Reluctance to change traditional methods (making asset owners aware of DT’s beneﬁts\\nis fundamental in gradual incremental deployment of the DT)\\n\\x0f Alternatives to generate required data to address data availability challenges include:\\n\\x0f IoT/industry internet of things (IIoT) technologies\\n\\x0f FEM (generating synthetic data via simulation though deﬁning the scenarios to simu-\\nlate and generate data is a challenge) and\\n\\x0f BIM as a source of data\\nFurthermore, the rising maintenance cost as well as the demand for services moti-\\nvates the regulatory bodies to be more ﬂexible and efﬁcient in implementing regulatory\\nprocedures and willingness to onboard innovative methods, which will result in overall\\nreduction in the asset management costs.\\nSo, this research is attempting to answer the following questions in relation to DT\\napplication in infrastructure maintenance management:\\n\\x0f Is DT application for infrastructure SHM using FEM models feasible?\\n\\x0f What are the challenges in terms of interoperability? How to make different soft-\\nware/platforms communicate with each other?\\n\\x0f What sensor conﬁguration is needed to collect the required data? How to determine\\nsensor locations?\\n4. Designing DT Architecture for Infrastructure SHM\\nDesigning DT of an infrastructure, for maintenance decision-making purposes, should\\ntake into account all required operational, organisational and technical information and be\\nable to run simulations of the physical object behaviour.\\nSince DT consists of both cyber and physical elements, it can be considered as a sys-\\ntems engineering approach, which seeks multidisciplinary stakeholder goals. DT can be\\ncreated in different ways depending on the purpose and structure lifecycle phase, which in\\nturn leads to different architectural designs. The architecture design of DT describes the\\ncomponents, interactions between them and the interaction of the DT as a whole with its\\nenvironment, i.e., physical twin and communication related elements [ 39]. The concept of\\nsemantic modelling which relates to illustration of the relationships between individual\\nelements as well as the bigger picture which will be explained in this section helps in under-\\nstanding the importance of DT architecture design. Furthermore, cybersecurity is essential\\nwhen moving towards more complex and intelligent DT systems, integrating advanced\\ntechnologies, such as IoT/IIoT, data processing algorithms, remote communications and\\nsimulation processes [10].\\nAs previously stated, DT include a physical object (which exists in real-world/environment),\\nand a virtual object (a digital representation of a physical object in virtual world/environment).\\nAccording to Tekinerdogan et al. [39], following are some of other key concepts related to DT:\\n\\x0f State: Current value/condition of either of the entities (physical or virtual objects)\\n\\x0f Metrology: Measuring/gauging state of either of the entities (physical or virtual)\\n\\x0f Twining: As the name implies this is the process of communicating the entities’ state\\nto each other\\n\\x0f Data processing: this is related to analysis and process of the telemetry data from real\\nobject collected from sensors\\n\\x0f Realisation: this is after on boarding the result of the data processing in the previous\\nstep which results in changing the state of the physical/virtual objects\\n\\x0f Twining rate: is related to the frequency of creating the connection between the two entities\\n\\x0f Physical to virtual and virtual to physical connection: relate to the connection ﬂow\\ndirection between the two entities\\nThere are also some innovative concepts which researchers have put forward and are\\nconsidered futuristic including federated learning or blockchain in DT which add to the\\nsystem’s security, transparency etc. and result in more efﬁciency [ 40]. Before explaining DTSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 10 of 25\\narchitecture design, semantic modelling, data processing and physical–digital integration\\nwill be further explained.\\n4.1. Semantic Modelling\\nOne of the challenges in realising IoT ecosystems is the way to provide common\\nunderstanding of data which add value to the subject ecosystem through analysis and\\nproviding solutions to existing issues. Automated data sharing, exchanging, and securely\\naccessing is critical in creating multi-stakeholder IoT systems. Semantic technologies\\naddress these challenges [41].\\nSemantic, in the linguistics context, is deﬁned as the study of meanings, but it is an\\nimportant concept in domains such as computer science [ 42]. In simple words, semantic\\nmodelling understandably depicts the relationships between speciﬁc data values relative\\nto one another and the bigger picture in its concept. As an example, in mapping the data\\nrelated to a bridge collapse after inspecting its components including piers and foundations,\\nthe data modelling in Figure 5 doesn’t reveal the bigger picture clearly (i.e., infrastructure\\ncollapse and its underlying factors) and therefore it is not possible to understand what it\\nwants to present.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 26 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5.

Since applying DT for intelligent and ef ficient infrastructure maintenance is to en-\\nhance the overall system’s intelligence, infrastr ucture DT architecture design requires un-\\nderstanding several independent, but related, domains.

The architectural design of\\nDT depends on the overall purpose and application context since, in practice, DTs can be\\napplied in various ways to different problems or to different lifecycle phases [ 39]. Since\\napplying DT for intelligent and efficient infrastructure maintenance is to enhance the overall\\nsystem’s intelligence, infrastructure DT architecture design requires understanding several\\nindependent, but related, domains. Key characteristics when designing an infrastructure DT\\narchitecture include:Sustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 13 of 25\\n\\x0f a visualised digital replica containing geometric and semantic data in terms of materi-\\nals, stresses, and strains\\n\\x0f utilising data spanning along the infrastructure whole life cycle, i.e., planning, design,\\nconstructing, operation and maintenance, and disposal\\n\\x0f physical connection (i.e., to monitor existing state in real time)\\n\\x0f ability to inform future projects and maintenance practices through generating valuable\\ninformative data from processing real-time data and/or simulating what-if scenarios\\nTherefore, the following are challenges ahead of developing an infrastructure DT for\\nintelligent maintenance purpose:\\n\\x0f Building appropriate model of an infrastructure (multi-domain, multi-disciplinary)\\n\\x0f Establishing the connection between the infrastructure and its DT to support seam-\\nless monitoring\\n\\x0f Integrating different services\\n\\x0f Consolidating data from physical model and its DT and developing data aggregation\\nand interpretation methods/algorithms (key to generating consumable information) and\\n\\x0f Developing maintenance measure decision-making methods\\nSo, the major questions to answer when developing an infrastructure DT, include:\\n\\x0f Which parts/components need to be monitored?\\n\\x0f What domain needs to be measured (e.g., displacement, temperature, deﬂection etc.)?\\n\\x0f Which sensors (and conﬁguration/arrangement) are adopted to monitor and measure\\ninfrastructure responses?\\n\\x0f What are the thresholds for fault warnings? (e.g., the predeﬁned allowable tolerance\\nfor the measured strain by a strain gauge before a fault alarm is triggered)\\n\\x0f What is the frequency of data collection and simulation to make the system efﬁcient?\\n\\x0f What analysis processes are needed to drive and interpret the data (modelling and\\nsimulation)?\\nIn practical applications, if not impossible, it is difﬁcult to directly measure external\\nacting force on a performing infrastructure. In structural dynamics, where the response\\nof a structure is found from known loads applied to it, the problem is called forward\\nproblem. On the other hand, an inverse problem is where the response of a structure is\\nestimated from physical sensor measurements attached to it. A strain gauge is a type of\\nelectrical sensor with the primary application of measuring strain. When an external load\\nis applied to an infrastructure, two parameters exist including stress and strain. Stress is\\nthe resisting force, which pushes back in the opposite direction of the applied load, and\\nstrain is the deformation within the infrastructure, which can be measured by the strain\\ngauge sensor. In an inverse method for structural analysis, strain gauges measure the strain\\n(both expansion and contraction) to calculate the causing stress. Then, the applied load to\\nthe structural component can be calculated from the measured stress.\\nFigure 9 presents the process map to implement the DT technology for infrastructure\\nintelligent maintenance.\\nGiven the purpose of this study, which is efﬁcient and intelligent monitoring and\\nunderstanding the structural performance of an in-operation structure, in Figure 9, the\\nsection which is related to the proposed DT approach is highlighted in blue.

Then, extracted data including faulty components will be visualised to:\\n(1) display the structure health state and performance timeline, and (2) visually present the\\nfaulty components in an interpretable and expressible manner.\\nTo decide about alternative maintenance solutions for the diagnosed failure, the\\nproposed method chooses the preferred maintenance measure from either a series of\\npre-arranged maintenance measures or through a qualitative decision-making method.\\nPre-arranged maintenance measures are based on historical data. They are maintenance\\nmeasures which have been previously applied to similar structural failure and are likely to\\nbe effective. They can be relied upon for quicker and more effective responses to similar\\nfailure modes and therefore bring about cost and time savings.\\nOn the other hand, if the failure mode is new and unknown, the proposed architecture\\ndesign utilises a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method in a fuzzy environment\\nto qualitatively prioritise different maintenance alternatives [ 45]. Beneﬁts of the fuzzy\\nMCDM method include: (1) qualitatively evaluating potential maintenance measures\\nwhile considering uncertainty in judgements (thanks to the fuzzy logic and its ability toSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 15 of 25\\ntake into account the footprint of uncertainty in subjective/qualitative decision-making\\nenvironments), and (2) enabling the asset owner to select the best maintenance measure\\noption based on its current asset management strategy (i.e., MCDM enables the asset owner\\nto choose the maintenance measure which provides the most optimum outcome that is\\ndesired by an organisation’s maintenance strategy at the time). The proposed MCDM\\nmethod also is ﬂexible in terms of the number of evaluation criteria and maintenance\\nalternatives that can be considered for evaluation.\\nBefore being implemented, the selected maintenance measure is simulated using\\nthe DT model to verify its effectiveness in addressing the identiﬁed defect(s). As can be\\nseen in the process map, this cycle (selecting a maintenance measure and simulating its\\neffectiveness) continues until the best maintenance measure is selected.\\nWhat-if scenarios discover the consequences of informal speculations before imple-\\nmentation, which can save time and cost. Another beneﬁt of the proposed DT model\\nincludes the ability to simulate a physical asset’s behaviour and evaluate its performance\\nand response under different scenarios before implementation and consequently bringing\\nabout considerable savings at the very early stage during strategic decision-making for\\nfuture investments.\\nAdvantages of the Proposed Architecture Compared to Existing Methods\\nThe proposed architecture offers the following beneﬁts:\\nData acquisition: existing infrastructure maintenance management methods (in practice)\\nrequire allocating workforce to attend the asset locations, conduct physical inspections (which\\nmight require shutting down the plant or infrastructure). However, the proposed method\\nutilises sensors to collect data, which brings about time and cost savings to the asset owners\\nas there will be no shut down required or manpower utilised to acquire real-time data.\\nData accuracy: existing methods use expert judgement (which always carries some level\\nof uncertainty) to identify defects and prescribe measures for rectification. The proposed\\nmethod, however, uses an objective approach, i.e., real-time data, to analyse the realistic status\\nof the asset, map it against the design expectation and then decide about its maintenance.\\nSome of the previous applications in utilising IoT technologies partially applied these\\ntechnologies to inform decision making about asset maintenance management. Examples\\nof such applications include Rubert et al. [ 18], which just utilised strain gauges to monitor\\nstrains in wind turbine foundation to avoid physical inspections, or Heo et al. [ 14], who\\naimed to develop a method to measure diverse structural responses based on wireless\\nsystem. Their test included measuring the distance that communication (wireless system)\\nis possible, and the accuracy of responses collected, or Muttillo et al. [ 6], who designed\\nan IoT system for SHM to identify possible damages and monitor structure performance\\nover time. Their work used smart devices to collect data and a data logger/interface to\\ndisplay the outputs, but did not run any structural analysis to analyse and monitor the\\noverall performance.

So, to achieve the objective of the digital twin, the inputs are applied to the 3D\\nmodel continuously and automatically to monitor the structure. To monitor the structure\\nchanges under different real-time loading conditions, ROM and sensor data should be\\nconnected in an IoT platform. ThingWorx ptc is selected as IoT platform to connect the\\nROM (in ANSYS Twin Builder) and sensor data (in Senscope software). Therefore, to\\nfederate all the sources into one IoT platform, a code is developed, and a Thing is created.\\nThe sequel code to generate a Thing is presented in Appendix A.4.\\nThen, as presented in Appendix A.5, a mashup page is created to map the data (from\\nsensors and ROM) in Thingworx. Senscope (which contains the sensor data) was connected\\nto Thingworx (IoT platform/hub) and real-time analysis of the static structural data of the\\nconveyor was conducted.\\n6. Conclusions\\nTo develop a DT for intelligent infrastructure maintenance purposes, ﬁrst the structural\\nhealth and behaviour of the infrastructure should be understood. This is achieved by\\ncollecting data from the infrastructure and conducting computational processing, and\\nsimulation. Real-time simulation modelling is useful where detailed information on the\\ninfrastructure dynamics can be achieved and enables us to determine the root causes of\\nstructural responses, including failures. Data modelling, on the other hand, is applicable forSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 20 of 25\\nsituations where sufﬁcient data can be obtained from the infrastructure for model learning,\\nbut the model cannot determine root causes. Furthermore, if a change in structure or\\noperation environment takes place, the previous data model cannot be used and a new\\nlearning model is required. Evaluating the structural health condition is then followed by\\nan infrastructure fault diagnosis and maintenance measure prescription.\\nThe advantages of the proposed DT approach in intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nmainly lie in the deep integration of cyber and physical environments. The proposed\\nDT concept is powered by integration, outcome orientated, is customisable, and built on\\ndata. Therefore, its success warrants the technological solution providers to integrate the\\nadvances and consequently facilitate the implementation of the DT technology.\\nIn this study we utilised tilt sensor, strain gauge, and vibrometer to monitor an\\noffshore jetty conveyor of a port terminal. Collected sensor data represented real structural\\nbehaviour of the jetty conveyor truss structure and was modelled in the ANSYS mechanical\\nFEA, provided by ANSYS, PA, USA, tool followed by a static ROM in ANSYS Twin Builder,\\nprovided by ANSYS, PA, USA. There are still many interoperability challenges to create\\nthe DT of infrastructure because of the dynamic loadings and complications in connecting\\nthem to the virtual models. As part of the future work for this study we are planning\\nto install strain gauges and displacement sensors, utilise different platforms/scripts to\\nfacilitate interoperability and communication between the different software which we\\nwill be using to dynamically monitor structural performance. Furthermore, we will be\\nusing the iTwin platform, provided by Bentley Systems, PA, USA, to conduct ﬁnite element\\nanalysis and use inverse methods to feed the sensor data to the digital model for simulation.\\nThe future work of this study will also include simulating maintenance measures before\\nimplementing, which will result in more time and cost savings in asset management.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M. and F.S.; methodology, M.M., S.S. and F.S.; software,\\nM.M.; writing—original draft preparation, F.S.; writing—review and editing, F.S., M.M. and S.M.;\\nsupervision, M.M. and S.S.; project administration, F.S. and M.M.

Utilising new technologies including the internet of\\nthings (IoT) and digital twin (DT) can signiﬁcantly reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs. An\\ninfrastructure DT involves its digital replica and must include data on geometric, geospatial reference,\\nperformance, attributes (material, environment etc.) and management. Then, the acquired data need\\nto be analysed and visualised to inform maintenance decision making. To develop this DT, the ﬁrst\\nstep is the study of the infrastructure life cycle to design DT architecture. Using data semantics,\\nthis paper presents a novel DT architecture design for an intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nsystem. Semantic modelling is used as a powerful tool to structure and organize data. This approach\\nprovides an industry context through capturing knowledge about infrastructures in the structure of\\nsemantic model graph. Using new technologies, DT approach derives and presents meaningful data\\non infrastructure real-time performance and maintenance requirements, and in a more expressible\\nand interpretable manner. The data semantic model will guide when and what data to collect for\\nfeeding into the infrastructure DT. The proposed DT concept was applied on one of the conveyors\\nof Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal in Queensland Australia to monitor the structural performance in\\nreal-time, which enables predictive maintenance to avoid breakdowns and disruptions in operation\\nand consequential ﬁnancial impacts.\\nKeywords: digital twin; internet of things; architecture design; data semantic modelling; intelligent\\ninfrastructure maintenance\\n1. Introduction\\nIncreasing utilisation and aging infrastructure has resulted in the requirement for\\ninfrastructure assets continuous health monitoring [1].\\nThere are about 22,500 bridges in Australia with a replacement cost of around AUD\\n3 billion , and an annual maintenance expenditure of about AUD 300 million [ 2]. The United\\nStates Federal Highway Administration incurs a bi-annual inspection cost of AUD 3.4 billion\\nwhere the average inspection cost for each bridge structure is AUD 5500 to 12,500.\\nThe architecture, engineering and construction industries combined worldwide an-\\nnual expenditure is more than AUD 10 trillion. These industries are globally the largest\\nconsumers of raw material, and their built assets are responsible for 25 to 40% of the world’s\\ntotal carbon emissions [ 3]. Furthermore, according to the World Bank, demand for civil\\ninfrastructure exceeds supply at a shortfall of AUD one trillion every year [3].\\nA total of 65% to 85% of the facility management cost is spent for their maintenance\\nand yet there is not an efﬁcient management and decision making strategy to optimise\\nthis cost [ 4]. In facility maintenance management, there are two main issues with existing\\nfacility management systems [4]:\\n\\x0f inability of computerised maintenance management systems or, in other words, facility\\nmanagement systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148664\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 2 of 25\\n\\x0f difﬁculty in accessing accurate information for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of\\nalmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures, utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspections\\n(level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and process\\nthe acquired data. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the currently in practice infrastructure\\nmaintenance management processes.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26\\n\\n• inability of computerised maintenance mana gement systems or, in other words, fa-\\ncility management systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\n• difficulty in accessing accurate informat ion for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of al-\\nmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures , utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspec-\\ntions (level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and\\nprocess the acquired data. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the currently in practice in-\\nfrastructure maintenance management processes.\\n\\nFigure 1. Overview of existing maintenance processes .\\nProblems of existing maintenance processes:\\n• Data exchange: One of the costly shortcomin gs of the existing processes is data ex-\\nchange during inspection planning, implementation and reporting, as most likely\\neach of these phases is conducted by a diff erent party (i.e., planners, inspectors, main-\\ntainers). In existing practices, data transfer from inspections, planning and mainte-nance needs to be either\\nmanually entere d or converted (to a compatible format),\\nwhich carries the risk of errors and data loss.\\n• Interoperability: This issue is an importan t function in data management [5]. Cur-\\nrently produced digital data are in differ ent formats and not necessarily compatible\\nbetween different software, which makes thei r lifespan limited and with little guar-\\nantee that the data will make it to later stages of asset utilisation. According to Smith\\nand Domer [3], the model-based applicatio n outputs’ interoperability challenges\\ncosts the U.S. facility owners USD 15.8 billion as a result of lost efficiency.

Notwithstanding this, the objectives of monitor-\\ning practices have similarities in working towards more precision in detecting damages,\\nstraightforward management, data storage, timeliness and reliability of the collected infor-\\nmation [ 6]. An international standard framework for data exchange is the ISO 15926 . Due\\nto not being speciﬁc for practical utilisation, many different specialisations of this standard\\nhave been derived without much alignment between them. There is not a universal dataSustainability 2022 ,14,\\n8664 3 of 25\\nmodel for conducting infrastructure inspections, identifying defects, or determining main-\\ntenance strategies which can avoid inconsistencies and inefﬁciencies. Furthermore, existing\\ndata exchange or transfer practices along different lifecycle phases (i.e., construction, plan-\\nning and implementing inspection, executing maintenance strategies, monitoring) could\\nresult in data loss and re-works due to inefﬁcient practices and interoperability difﬁculties\\nbetween the utilised technologies. Recent advances, such as unmanned aerial photography,\\nhas already resulted in reducing the risk of data loss and error. Though, even with this\\nadvancement, the problem of data loss while digitising the obtained analogue information\\nstill exists and retaining the lost data is costly and time consuming [7]. Another challenge\\nis ever increasing amounts of collected data, which needs to be stored and processed to\\nmake informed decisions about infrastructure maintenance as the existing practices do not\\nhave the capacity to keep up with the demand (due to scale of telemetry data and rapid\\ngrowth of systems and existing approaches, whose reliance on operators to detect and\\ncorrect anomalies in the systems is impractical [8]).\\nFollowing are different maintenance strategies based on the intervention time:\\n\\x0f Reactive (ﬁreﬁghting/corrective) also known as failure-based.\\n\\x0f Preventative—also known as time-based. DT approach (further explained in Section 4)\\ncan be utilised in preventative strategies to predict the state of an asset and therefore\\nreduce the number of unnecessary preventative maintenance activities providing\\nlonger time intervals between them.\\n\\x0f Condition-based (based on asset condition)—also known as diagnosis-based mainte-\\nnance (efﬁcient detection of anomalies in the existing condition of an asset and fast\\ndata processing is made possible thanks to the developed state of technologies such\\nas IOT and cloud computing [ 9]). Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can enhance this\\nmaintenance approach in diagnosing and acquiring detailed status data [10].\\n\\x0f Predictive (prognosis)—this approach can use a data driven (data driven techniques\\n(clustering, neural networks, Bayesian networks, support vector machine (SVM) and\\nprincipal components analysis (PCA)) are data-oriented, which can be obtained with\\nappropriate sensor deployment) or model driven (the model driven technique uses\\nmathematical methods (analytical, physical, or numerical models) to describe an asset)\\ntechnique to predict maintenance.\\nThe main process of maintenance prediction is prognosis.

The BIM\\nmodel highlights damaged elements using colour coding, which is based on predeﬁned\\nthreshold values [ 16]. Existing BIM-based approaches, especially the Industry Foundation\\nClasses (IFC) standard, only focus on describing sensor related information, and further\\naspects of SHM related information, such as real-time data processing and analysis, are not\\ncovered [15].\\nFeng and Feng [ 17] offered non-contact vision-based sensor systems for SHM due to\\ntheir ﬂexibility in extracting structural displacements at multiple locations. Their study\\naimed to link measured displacements to the quantiﬁcation of structural health condition\\nthrough validating feasible simultaneous identiﬁcation of the stiffness of structures and\\nunknown excitation forces in the time domain. Results of the laboratory experiment on a\\nsmall scall beam revealed that displacement measurements at two points along the beam\\ncan identify the global stiffness as well as external hammer excitation forces.\\nIn another study, metal packaged optical ﬁbre strain sensors were utilised to instru-\\nment selected reinforcement bars in a wind turbine foundation before concrete casting.\\nThe measured foundation strains showed a high extent correlation with measured tower\\ndisplacements as well as the foundation ﬁnite element model (FEM) analysis [ 18].

Their research claims to provide factual\\ninformation regarding the location and displacement amount of an existing fracture in\\na civil structure. An artiﬁcial neural network was also utilised in their study to infer\\nqualitative characteristics of the vibrations within the structure based on their intensity.\\nGlobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and Earth observation (EO) technologies\\nhave been attempted in a study by the University of Nottingham for SHM of a long span\\nbridge [ 13]. The initial results have shown signiﬁcant potential of the technologies and\\ntherefore the project was further extended to the demonstration stage where two long span\\nbridges in China were considered as test structures.\\nThree dimensional digital image correlation systems have proved their ability to\\nprovide reliable objective information of structural changes, strain and geometric proﬁles\\nof large structures [ 20]. Unmanned aerial vehicles technique have been combined with\\nthree dimensional digital image correlation by Reagan et al. [ 20] to monitor the structural\\nhealth of concrete infrastructures.\\nDT technology has recently gained momentum in being investigated for utilisation in\\nintelligent asset management. Infrastructure DT is the digital replica of an infrastructure\\nwhich enables simulation of its real-time performance. DT encompasses three aspects:\\nphysical object, its digital replica, and the communication channel between the two. DT\\ntechnology incorporates beneﬁts of most of the methods which have previously been\\nutilised for SHM including:\\n\\x0f BIM—to visualise the infrastructure performance\\n\\x0f sensors—to collect real-time data and\\n\\x0f structural analysis methods—to simulate and study structural performance (e.g., ﬁnite\\nelement analysis (FEA), which is a simulation method to objectively deﬁne and predict\\nthe performance of infrastructures)\\nDT has been researched in the SHM of spacecraft structures by Shangguan et al. [ 8],\\nsmall-scale knuckle boom crane by Moi et al. [ 21], and collapse fragility assessment of long\\nspan bridges under strong earthquakes by Lin et al. [22].\\nIn the next sections the terminologies and steps in developing DT architecture design\\nfor infrastructure SHM and its application on a port structure will be explained.\\n3. DT and Intelligent Infrastructure Maintenance\\nAccording to the literature, DT (in its current concept) was first proposed by Prof. Michael\\nGreives at the University of Michigan in 2002 [23]. Since then, the DT concept has evolved.\\nRosen et al. [ 24] introduced the DT concept as two identical physical and virtual spaces\\nwhich allow mirroring between them to analyse the conditions that they experience in\\ndifferent phases of the object’s lifecycle. Then, Boschert and Rosen [ 25] detailed that a DT\\nencompasses all the potential useful physical and functional information from a physical\\nobject/system/process. Furthermore, Boschert and Rosen [ 25] agree that DT not only is\\nformed by data but also algorithms that explain behaviours to make decisions. Grieves\\nand Vickers [ 26] deﬁned DT as: a physical product in a real space, virtual product in a\\nvirtual space and the connection of data, which ties the two together. The information\\nthey were referring to was a set of information that provides a comprehensive description\\nof a real object including from its most general geometry to its most concrete behaviour.\\nFurthermore, according to Smart Cities Council of Australia and New Zealand, a digital\\ntwin must include data sets including geometric and graphical data, geospatial reference\\ndata, attributes (semantics) of the material, and performance and management data [27].Sustainability 2022\\n,14, 8664 6 of 25\\nThe concept of using DT dates back to NASA’s Apollo program where two identical\\nspacecrafts/vehicles were manufactured to not only allow engineers to mirror the perfor-\\nmance of the space vehicle during the mission by monitoring the twin vehicle remaining\\non earth but also be used for training during ﬂight preparation [25].\\nThe U.S. Air Force also published the idea of establishing the concept of DT as being\\npart of their long-term vision. Their idea was to have a DT of every airplane with all\\ndeviations from its nominal design. Iron bird is another example of a twin in the form of\\nhardware. Iron bird is an engineering tool in the aircraft industry which is ground based and\\nis tasked to incorporate, optimise, and validate vital aircraft systems. The iron bird enables\\nengineers to validate characteristics of components of the system and discover anomalies\\nand incompatibilities that may need to be modiﬁed at early development stages. Iron\\nbird capabilities goes even further and allows engineers to study and analyse effects and\\ntreatments of failures. Improvements in the simulation technologies allow the engineers to\\nutilise the concept of iron bird but replace the hardware parts with virtual models even\\nbefore the physical parts are built.\\nSimulation and modelling are nowadays a standard process to support designing\\nor validating system properties. To describe all the disciplines in a system—both sepa-\\nrately and in combination with other disciplines—simulation models are needed and only\\nsimulation models will enable the mastering of the extended challenges resulting from\\nnew technologies, which are used in all kinds of systems [ 25]. Classical goals, which are\\npursued from simulation, are to reduce development time/time-to-market, reduce the cost\\nof developing a system/product, and meeting quality and client requirements. As can be\\nseen in Figure 3, recently, simulation has evolved from being a technology restricted to com-\\nputer experts and mathematicians to a standard tool for engineers to simulate speculated\\nscenarios in developing engineering designs.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 26\\n\\n\\nFigure 3.

DT Application in Improving Maintenance Practices\\nDT is a smart way to collect all essential information about an asset in one place\\nand beneﬁt from improved consistency and seamless development processes at early\\nstages and re-use of collected data for maintenance decision making at later lifecycle\\nstages [ 25]. Maintenance is one of the most researched lifecycle phases of different indus-\\ntries. Errandonea et al. [10] conducted a review on the application of DT in maintenance\\nwithin different industries. Their review included a total of 167 results, which included\\njournal and conference articles, book chapters, reviews, and business articles. According to\\ntheir review, the manufacturing industry is the number one ﬁeld with the highest amount\\nof research on implementing DT followed by industries with offshore infrastructure, such\\nas oil and gas and wind turbines. In a study conducted by Wang et al. [ 29] on the DT related\\npatents, they also concluded most of the DT-related patents appear in the manufacturing\\nindustry. Construction (buildings and bridges) and aeronautics are in third place in the\\nresearch on the application of DT.\\nDT have been previously used to partially improve maintenance strategies, for example\\nmaintenance planning by Hlady et al. [ 30], fault detection and diagnosis by Barbosa et al. [ 31],\\ncalculating maintenance cost by Kaewunruen and Xu [32], or helping operators in performing\\nspecific maintenance tasks by Pairet et al. [ 33]; Rødseth et al. [ 34]; Longo et al. [ 35]; V enables [ 36];\\nOmer et al. [37]; and Anderson et al. [38].\\nAs mentioned in Section 1, there are ﬁve different maintenance strategies including\\nreactive, preventative, condition based, predictive and prescriptive depending on interven-\\ntion time. Reactive maintenance does not need to utilise an expensive technology, such as\\nDT, as a reactive strategy consists of repairing an asset or a component when it fails.\\nDT has application in preventative maintenance strategies to predict the state of\\ninfrastructure and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary preventative maintenance\\nactivities providing longer time intervals between them.\\nFurthermore, condition-based maintenance, or the detection of anomalies in the exist-\\ning condition of an infrastructure, is made possible thanks to the advanced technologies,\\nsuch as IoT and cloud computing. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms can enhance this\\nmaintenance approach in diagnosing and acquiring detailed status data.\\nAs previously stated in Section 1, predictive and prescriptive strategies offer the high-\\nest potential in existing digitisation trends and can use a data or model driven techniques\\nto predict maintenance.\\nSo far, only condition-based, and predictive maintenance strategies have been re-\\nsearched in the construction industry and no paper is found in prescriptive maintenance\\nstrategy in the construction industry as far as our review of the literature is concerned.\\n3.2. Roadblocks, Alternatives and Research Questions\\nThe roadblocks in evolving from basic maintenance strategies to more advanced\\nstrategies using a DT technology includes:\\n\\x0f A detailed maintenance procedure to structure the processes\\n\\x0f Data availability, integrity, security, and quality\\n\\x0f Regulatory barriers (regulatory bodies have a timely process in adopting new technologies)Sustainability\\n2022 ,14, 8664 9 of 25\\n\\x0f Reluctance to change traditional methods (making asset owners aware of DT’s beneﬁts\\nis fundamental in gradual incremental deployment of the DT)\\n\\x0f Alternatives to generate required data to address data availability challenges include:\\n\\x0f IoT/industry internet of things (IIoT) technologies\\n\\x0f FEM (generating synthetic data via simulation though deﬁning the scenarios to simu-\\nlate and generate data is a challenge) and\\n\\x0f BIM as a source of data\\nFurthermore, the rising maintenance cost as well as the demand for services moti-\\nvates the regulatory bodies to be more ﬂexible and efﬁcient in implementing regulatory\\nprocedures and willingness to onboard innovative methods, which will result in overall\\nreduction in the asset management costs.\\nSo, this research is attempting to answer the following questions in relation to DT\\napplication in infrastructure maintenance management:\\n\\x0f Is DT application for infrastructure SHM using FEM models feasible?\\n\\x0f What are the challenges in terms of interoperability? How to make different soft-\\nware/platforms communicate with each other?\\n\\x0f What sensor conﬁguration is needed to collect the required data? How to determine\\nsensor locations?\\n4. Designing DT Architecture for Infrastructure SHM\\nDesigning DT of an infrastructure, for maintenance decision-making purposes, should\\ntake into account all required operational, organisational and technical information and be\\nable to run simulations of the physical object behaviour.\\nSince DT consists of both cyber and physical elements, it can be considered as a sys-\\ntems engineering approach, which seeks multidisciplinary stakeholder goals. DT can be\\ncreated in different ways depending on the purpose and structure lifecycle phase, which in\\nturn leads to different architectural designs. The architecture design of DT describes the\\ncomponents, interactions between them and the interaction of the DT as a whole with its\\nenvironment, i.e., physical twin and communication related elements [ 39]. The concept of\\nsemantic modelling which relates to illustration of the relationships between individual\\nelements as well as the bigger picture which will be explained in this section helps in under-\\nstanding the importance of DT architecture design. Furthermore, cybersecurity is essential\\nwhen moving towards more complex and intelligent DT systems, integrating advanced\\ntechnologies, such as IoT/IIoT, data processing algorithms, remote communications and\\nsimulation processes [10].\\nAs previously stated, DT include a physical object (which exists in real-world/environment),\\nand a virtual object (a digital representation of a physical object in virtual world/environment).\\nAccording to Tekinerdogan et al. [39], following are some of other key concepts related to DT:\\n\\x0f State: Current value/condition of either of the entities (physical or virtual objects)\\n\\x0f Metrology: Measuring/gauging state of either of the entities (physical or virtual)\\n\\x0f Twining: As the name implies this is the process of communicating the entities’ state\\nto each other\\n\\x0f Data processing: this is related to analysis and process of the telemetry data from real\\nobject collected from sensors\\n\\x0f Realisation: this is after on boarding the result of the data processing in the previous\\nstep which results in changing the state of the physical/virtual objects\\n\\x0f Twining rate: is related to the frequency of creating the connection between the two entities\\n\\x0f Physical to virtual and virtual to physical connection: relate to the connection ﬂow\\ndirection between the two entities\\nThere are also some innovative concepts which researchers have put forward and are\\nconsidered futuristic including federated learning or blockchain in DT which add to the\\nsystem’s security, transparency etc. and result in more efﬁciency [ 40]. Before explaining DTSustainability\\n2022 ,14, 8664 10 of 25\\narchitecture design, semantic modelling, data processing and physical–digital integration\\nwill be further explained.\\n4.1. Semantic Modelling\\nOne of the challenges in realising IoT ecosystems is the way to provide common\\nunderstanding of data which add value to the subject ecosystem through analysis and\\nproviding solutions to existing issues. Automated data sharing, exchanging, and securely\\naccessing is critical in creating multi-stakeholder IoT systems. Semantic technologies\\naddress these challenges [41].\\nSemantic, in the linguistics context, is deﬁned as the study of meanings, but it is an\\nimportant concept in domains such as computer science [ 42]. In simple words, semantic\\nmodelling understandably depicts the relationships between speciﬁc data values relative\\nto one another and the bigger picture in its concept. As an example, in mapping the data\\nrelated to a bridge collapse after inspecting its components including piers and foundations,\\nthe data modelling in Figure 5 doesn’t reveal the bigger picture clearly (i.e., infrastructure\\ncollapse and its underlying factors) and therefore it is not possible to understand what it\\nwants to present.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 26\\n\\n\\nFigure 5.

Since\\napplying DT for intelligent and efficient infrastructure maintenance is to enhance the overall\\nsystem’s intelligence, infrastructure DT architecture design requires understanding several\\nindependent, but related, domains.

(e.g., the predeﬁned allowable tolerance\\nfor the measured strain by a strain gauge before a fault alarm is triggered)\\n\\x0f What is the frequency of data collection and simulation to make the system efﬁcient?\\n\\x0f What analysis processes are needed to drive and interpret the data (modelling and\\nsimulation)?\\nIn practical applications, if not impossible, it is difﬁcult to directly measure external\\nacting force on a performing infrastructure. In structural dynamics, where the response\\nof a structure is found from known loads applied to it, the problem is called forward\\nproblem. On the other hand, an inverse problem is where the response of a structure is\\nestimated from physical sensor measurements attached to it. A strain gauge is a type of\\nelectrical sensor with the primary application of measuring strain. When an external load\\nis applied to an infrastructure, two parameters exist including stress and strain. Stress is\\nthe resisting force, which pushes back in the opposite direction of the applied load, and\\nstrain is the deformation within the infrastructure, which can be measured by the strain\\ngauge sensor. In an inverse method for structural analysis, strain gauges measure the strain\\n(both expansion and contraction) to calculate the causing stress. Then, the applied load to\\nthe structural component can be calculated from the measured stress.\\nFigure 9 presents the process map to implement the DT technology for infrastructure\\nintelligent maintenance.\\nGiven the purpose of this study, which is efﬁcient and intelligent monitoring and\\nunderstanding the structural performance of an in-operation structure, in Figure 9, the\\nsection which is related to the proposed DT approach is highlighted in blue.

Then, extracted data including faulty components will be visualised to:\\n(1) display the structure health state and performance timeline, and (2) visually present the\\nfaulty components in an interpretable and expressible manner.\\nTo decide about alternative maintenance solutions for the diagnosed failure, the\\nproposed method chooses the preferred maintenance measure from either a series of\\npre-arranged maintenance measures or through a qualitative decision-making method.\\nPre-arranged maintenance measures are based on historical data. They are maintenance\\nmeasures which have been previously applied to similar structural failure and are likely to\\nbe effective. They can be relied upon for quicker and more effective responses to similar\\nfailure modes and therefore bring about cost and time savings.\\nOn the other hand, if the failure mode is new and unknown, the proposed architecture\\ndesign utilises a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method in a fuzzy environment\\nto qualitatively prioritise different maintenance alternatives [ 45]. Beneﬁts of the fuzzy\\nMCDM method include: (1) qualitatively evaluating potential maintenance measures\\nwhile considering uncertainty in judgements (thanks to the fuzzy logic and its ability toSustainability 2022\\n,14, 8664 15 of 25\\ntake into account the footprint of uncertainty in subjective/qualitative decision-making\\nenvironments), and (2) enabling the asset owner to select the best maintenance measure\\noption based on its current asset management strategy (i.e., MCDM enables the asset owner\\nto choose the maintenance measure which provides the most optimum outcome that is\\ndesired by an organisation’s maintenance strategy at the time). The proposed MCDM\\nmethod also is ﬂexible in terms of the number of evaluation criteria and maintenance\\nalternatives that can be considered for evaluation.\\nBefore being implemented, the selected maintenance measure is simulated using\\nthe DT model to verify its effectiveness in addressing the identiﬁed defect(s). As can be\\nseen in the process map, this cycle (selecting a maintenance measure and simulating its\\neffectiveness) continues until the best maintenance measure is selected.\\nWhat-if scenarios discover the consequences of informal speculations before imple-\\nmentation, which can save time and cost. Another beneﬁt of the proposed DT model\\nincludes the ability to simulate a physical asset’s behaviour and evaluate its performance\\nand response under different scenarios before implementation and consequently bringing\\nabout considerable savings at the very early stage during strategic decision-making for\\nfuture investments.\\nAdvantages of the Proposed Architecture Compared to Existing Methods\\nThe proposed architecture offers the following beneﬁts:\\nData acquisition: existing infrastructure maintenance management methods (in practice)\\nrequire allocating workforce to attend the asset locations, conduct physical inspections (which\\nmight require shutting down the plant or infrastructure). However, the proposed method\\nutilises sensors to collect data, which brings about time and cost savings to the asset owners\\nas there will be no shut down required or manpower utilised to acquire real-time data.\\nData accuracy: existing methods use expert judgement (which always carries some level\\nof uncertainty) to identify defects and prescribe measures for rectification. The proposed\\nmethod, however, uses an objective approach, i.e., real-time data, to analyse the realistic status\\nof the asset, map it against the design expectation and then decide about its maintenance.\\nSome of the previous applications in utilising IoT technologies partially applied these\\ntechnologies to inform decision making about asset maintenance management. Examples\\nof such applications include Rubert et al. [ 18], which just utilised strain gauges to monitor\\nstrains in wind turbine foundation to avoid physical inspections, or Heo et al. [ 14], who\\naimed to develop a method to measure diverse structural responses based on wireless\\nsystem. Their test included measuring the distance that communication (wireless system)\\nis possible, and the accuracy of responses collected, or Muttillo et al.

Conclusions\\nTo develop a DT for intelligent infrastructure maintenance purposes, ﬁrst the structural\\nhealth and behaviour of the infrastructure should be understood. This is achieved by\\ncollecting data from the infrastructure and conducting computational processing, and\\nsimulation. Real-time simulation modelling is useful where detailed information on the\\ninfrastructure dynamics can be achieved and enables us to determine the root causes of\\nstructural responses, including failures. Data modelling, on the other hand, is applicable forSustainability\\n2022 ,14, 8664 20 of 25\\nsituations where sufﬁcient data can be obtained from the infrastructure for model learning,\\nbut the model cannot determine root causes. Furthermore, if a change in structure or\\noperation environment takes place, the previous data model cannot be used and a new\\nlearning model is required. Evaluating the structural health condition is then followed by\\nan infrastructure fault diagnosis and maintenance measure prescription.\\nThe advantages of the proposed DT approach in intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nmainly lie in the deep integration of cyber and physical environments. The proposed\\nDT concept is powered by integration, outcome orientated, is customisable, and built on\\ndata. Therefore, its success warrants the technological solution providers to integrate the\\nadvances and consequently facilitate the implementation of the DT technology.\\nIn this study we utilised tilt sensor, strain gauge, and vibrometer to monitor an\\noffshore jetty conveyor of a port terminal. Collected sensor data represented real structural\\nbehaviour of the jetty conveyor truss structure and was modelled in the ANSYS mechanical\\nFEA, provided by ANSYS, PA, USA, tool followed by a static ROM in ANSYS Twin Builder,\\nprovided by ANSYS, PA, USA. There are still many interoperability challenges to create\\nthe DT of infrastructure because of the dynamic loadings and complications in connecting\\nthem to the virtual models. As part of the future work for this study we are planning\\nto install strain gauges and displacement sensors, utilise different platforms/scripts to\\nfacilitate interoperability and communication between the different software which we\\nwill be using to dynamically monitor structural performance. Furthermore, we will be\\nusing the iTwin platform, provided by Bentley Systems, PA, USA, to conduct ﬁnite element\\nanalysis and use inverse methods to feed the sensor data to the digital model for simulation.\\nThe future work of this study will also include simulating maintenance measures before\\nimplementing, which will result in more time and cost savings in asset management.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M. and F.S.; methodology, M.M., S.S. and F.S.; software,\\nM.M.; writing—original draft preparation, F.S.; writing—review and editing, F.S., M.M. and S.M.;\\nsupervision, M.M. and S.S.; project administration, F.S. and M.M.

Utilising new technologies including the internet of\\nthings (IoT) and digital twin (DT) can signiﬁcantly reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs. An\\ninfrastructure DT involves its digital replica and must include data on geometric, geospatial reference,\\nperformance, attributes (material, environment etc.) and management. Then, the acquired data need\\nto be analysed and visualised to inform maintenance decision making. To develop this DT, the ﬁrst\\nstep is the study of the infrastructure life cycle to design DT architecture. Using data semantics,\\nthis paper presents a novel DT architecture design for an intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nsystem. Semantic modelling is used as a powerful tool to structure and organize data. This approach\\nprovides an industry context through capturing knowledge about infrastructures in the structure of\\nsemantic model graph. Using new technologies, DT approach derives and presents meaningful data\\non infrastructure real-time performance and maintenance requirements, and in a more expressible\\nand interpretable manner. The data semantic model will guide when and what data to collect for\\nfeeding into the infrastructure DT. The proposed DT concept was applied on one of the conveyors\\nof Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal in Queensland Australia to monitor the structural performance in\\nreal-time, which enables predictive maintenance to avoid breakdowns and disruptions in operation\\nand consequential ﬁnancial impacts.\\nKeywords: digital twin; internet of things; architecture design; data semantic modelling; intelligent\\ninfrastructure maintenance\\n1. Introduction\\nIncreasing utilisation and aging infrastructure has resulted in the requirement for\\ninfrastructure assets continuous health monitoring [1].\\nThere are about 22,500 bridges in Australia with a replacement cost of around AUD\\n3 billion , and an annual maintenance expenditure of about AUD 300 million [ 2]. The United\\nStates Federal Highway Administration incurs a bi-annual inspection cost of AUD 3.4 billion\\nwhere the average inspection cost for each bridge structure is AUD 5500 to 12,500.\\nThe architecture, engineering and construction industries combined worldwide an-\\nnual expenditure is more than AUD 10 trillion. These industries are globally the largest\\nconsumers of raw material, and their built assets are responsible for 25 to 40% of the world’s\\ntotal carbon emissions [ 3]. Furthermore, according to the World Bank, demand for civil\\ninfrastructure exceeds supply at a shortfall of AUD one trillion every year [3].\\nA total of 65% to 85% of the facility management cost is spent for their maintenance\\nand yet there is not an efﬁcient management and decision making strategy to optimise\\nthis cost [ 4]. In facility maintenance management, there are two main issues with existing\\nfacility management systems [4]:\\n\\x0f inability of computerised maintenance management systems or, in other words, facility\\nmanagement systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148664\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 2 of 25\\n\\x0f difﬁculty in accessing accurate information for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of\\nalmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures, utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspections\\n(level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and process\\nthe acquired data. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the currently in practice infrastructure\\nmaintenance management processes.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26'"

Utilising new technologies including the internet of\\nthings (IoT) and digital twin (DT) can signiﬁcantly reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs. An\\ninfrastructure DT involves its digital replica and must include data on geometric, geospatial reference,\\nperformance, attributes (material, environment etc.) and management. Then, the acquired data need\\nto be analysed and visualised to inform maintenance decision making. To develop this DT, the ﬁrst\\nstep is the study of the infrastructure life cycle to design DT architecture. Using data semantics,\\nthis paper presents a novel DT architecture design for an intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nsystem. Semantic modelling is used as a powerful tool to structure and organize data. This approach\\nprovides an industry context through capturing knowledge about infrastructures in the structure of\\nsemantic model graph. Using new technologies, DT approach derives and presents meaningful data\\non infrastructure real-time performance and maintenance requirements, and in a more expressible\\nand interpretable manner. The data semantic model will guide when and what data to collect for\\nfeeding into the infrastructure DT. The proposed DT concept was applied on one of the conveyors\\nof Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal in Queensland Australia to monitor the structural performance in\\nreal-time, which enables predictive maintenance to avoid breakdowns and disruptions in operation\\nand consequential ﬁnancial impacts.\\nKeywords: digital twin; internet of things; architecture design; data semantic modelling; intelligent\\ninfrastructure maintenance\\n1. Introduction\\nIncreasing utilisation and aging infrastructure has resulted in the requirement for\\ninfrastructure assets continuous health monitoring [1].\\nThere are about 22,500 bridges in Australia with a replacement cost of around AUD\\n3 billion , and an annual maintenance expenditure of about AUD 300 million [ 2]. The United\\nStates Federal Highway Administration incurs a bi-annual inspection cost of AUD 3.4 billion\\nwhere the average inspection cost for each bridge structure is AUD 5500 to 12,500.\\nThe architecture, engineering and construction industries combined worldwide an-\\nnual expenditure is more than AUD 10 trillion. These industries are globally the largest\\nconsumers of raw material, and their built assets are responsible for 25 to 40% of the world’s\\ntotal carbon emissions [ 3]. Furthermore, according to the World Bank, demand for civil\\ninfrastructure exceeds supply at a shortfall of AUD one trillion every year [3].\\nA total of 65% to 85% of the facility management cost is spent for their maintenance\\nand yet there is not an efﬁcient management and decision making strategy to optimise\\nthis cost [ 4]. In facility maintenance management, there are two main issues with existing\\nfacility management systems [4]:\\n\\x0f inability of computerised maintenance management systems or, in other words, facility\\nmanagement systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148664\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 2 of 25\\n\\x0f difﬁculty in accessing accurate information for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of\\nalmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures, utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspections\\n(level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and process\\nthe acquired data. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the currently in practice infrastructure\\nmaintenance management processes.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26', metadata={})"
