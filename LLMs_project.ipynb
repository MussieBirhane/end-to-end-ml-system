        "In recent years, most engineering sectors have been impacted and benefited from new tools and technologies. Digital transformation, positively linked with productivity, has changed how engineers operate and make decisions. However, digital transformation evolution in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry has been slow compared to other engineering industries sectors, such as mechanical, electrical, electronic, and manufacturing workflow[6], [7]. It is now more critical than ever that the AEC industry equip itself and benefit from the right technologies for sustainable growth.\n",
        "At this time, artificial intelligence is one of the fastest-growing emerging technologies and describes machines that can perform tasks that previously required human intelligence. Many tasks engineers are responsible for, such as design and simulation, can be enhanced with the support of artificial intelligence tools.\n",
        "Machine learning (ML) takes it a step further. It is one of the latest artificial intelligence technologies where in recent years, advanced ML algorithms have been successfully applied to many areas of engineering. Their success is assumed from the detailed processing of data that captures the system behaviour. By detecting patterns in the collected data, valuable information can be extracted, and reliable predictions can be made that automate the decision-making process. That fact introduces ML as an advanced tool in modern engineering. ML technologies could be a promising solution to overcome the complexity of nonlinear structural modelling and time- consuming analysis.\n",
        "10\n",
        "Accordingly, many theoretical studies have been done, studying the use of ML for predicting nonlinear seismic responses. However, ML trials were more theoretical and limited in terms of inputs (e.g., building topology, loading) and outputs, such as structural responses. Due to this limitation in the range of inputs and outputs, most theoretical studies are not applicable to practice.\n",
        "1.3 Thesis objective and organization\n",

steel structures, has been prepared by Technical \\nCommittee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is \\nresponsible for all Structural Eurocodes. \\nThis European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical \\ntext or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn \\nat latest by March 2010. \\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. \\nAccording to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the \\nfollowing countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech \\nRepublic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia, \\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn, \\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom. \\nBackground of the Eurocode programme \\nIn 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of \\nconstruction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of \\ntechnical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations. \\nWithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical \\nrules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the national \\nrules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. \\nFor fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member \\nStates, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of \\nEuropean codes in the 1980s. \\nIn 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I \\nbetween the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the \\nCEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). \\nThis links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s \\nDecisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products \\n~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and \\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). \\nThe Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of \\nParts: \\nEN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design \\nEN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures \\nEN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures \\nEN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures \\nEN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures \\nEN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures \\nEN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures \\nEN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design \\nEN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance \\nI Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) \\nconcerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). \\n5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nEN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures \\nEurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have \\nsafeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these \\ncontinue to vary from State to State. \\nStatus and field of application of Eurocodes \\nThe Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the \\nfonowing purposes: \\nas a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements \\nof Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 -Mechanical resistance and \\nstability -and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire; \\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; \\nas a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and \\nETAs) \\nThe Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the \\nInterpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from \\nharmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be \\nadequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product \\nstandards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. \\nThe Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole \\nstructures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of \\nconstruction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be \\nrequired by the designer in such cases. \\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes \\nThe National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any \\nannexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and \\nmay be followed by a National annex (informative). \\nThe National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in \\nthe Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of \\nbuildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : \\nvalues for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode, \\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~ \\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map, \\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode, \\nreferences to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. \\nLinks between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs \\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in interpretative documents for the \\ncreation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs. \\nAccording to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : \\na) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating classes \\nwhere necessary; \\nb) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of \\ncalculation and technical rules for design. etc. ; \\nc) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. \\nThe Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2. \\n6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nThere is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products \\nand the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the \\nconstIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined \\nParaIneters have been taken into account. \\nAdditional information specific to EN 1993-1 \\nEN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on \\nstructures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to. \\nEN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules \\nintended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6.

Wherc a plastic hingc \\noccurs in a ll1cmber, thc mcmber cross sections should be double symnlctric or single symmetric with a plane \\nof symmetry in the sanle plane as the rotation of the plastic hinge and it should satisfy thc rcquirements \\nspecified in 5.6. Where a plastic hinge occurs in a joint the joint should either have sufficient strength to \\nensure the hinge remains in the member or should be able to sustain the plastic resistance for a sufficient \\nrotatio11, see EN 1993-1-8. \\n(4)B As a simplified method for a limited plastic redistribution of moments in continuous beams where \\nfollowing an elastic analysis some peak moments exceed the plastic bending resistance of 15 % maximum, \\nthe parts in excess of these peak moments may bc redistributed in any membcr, provided, that: \\na) the internal forces and moments in the framc remain in equilibrium with the applicd loads, and \\nb) all the members in which the moments are reduced have Class 1 or Class 2 cross-sections (sce 5.5), and \\nc) lateral torsional buckling of the members is prevented. \\n5.4.2 Elastic global analysis \\n(1) Elastic global analysis should be based on the assumption that the stress-strain bchaviour of thc \\nmaterial is linear, whatever the stress level is. \\nNOTE For the choice of a semi-continuous joint model see 5.1.2 \\n(2) Intemal forces and moments may be calculated according to elastic global analysis cvcn if thc \\nresistance of a cross section is based on its plastic resistance, scc 6.2. \\n(3) Elastic global analysis may also be used for cross sections the resistances of which are limited by local \\nbuckling, see 6.2. \\n5.4.3 Plastic global analysis \\n(l) Plastic global analysis allows for the effects of material non-linearity in calculating thc action cffects \\nof a stnlctural system. Thc bchaviour should be modcllcd by one of the following mcthods: \\nby elastic-plastic analysis with plastified scctions and/or joints as plastic hingcs, \\nby non-linear plastic analysis considering the partial plastificatio11 of membcrs in plastic lones, \\nby rigid plastic analysis neglecting thc elastic behaviour betwecn hingcs. \\n(2) Plastic global analysis may be used where the members are capable of sufficicnt rotation capacity to \\nenable the required redistributions ofbcnding Inomcnts to develop, see 5.5 and 5.6. \\n(3) Plastic global analysis should only be used where the stability of members at plastic hinges can be \\nassured, see 6.3.5. \\n(4) The bi-linear stress-strain relationship indicated in Figure 5.8 may be used for thc grades of structural \\nsteel specified in section 3. Altenlatively, a more precise relationship may be adoptcd, see EN 1993-1-5. \\n(J\" \\nFigure 5.8: Bi-linear stress-strain relationship \\n39 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(5) Rigid plastic analysis may be applied if no effects of the deformed geomehy (e.g. second-order \\neffects) have to be considered. Tn this case joints are classified only by strength, see EN 1993-1-8. \\n(6) The effects of deformed geometry of the structure and the structural stability of the frame should be \\nverified according to the principles in 5.2. \\nNOTE The maximum resistance of a frame with significantly deformed geomehy may occur before \\nall hinges of the first order collapse mechanism have fonned. \\n5.5 Classification of cross sections \\n5.5.1 Basis \\n(1) The role of cross section classification is to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation \\ncapacity of cross sections is limited by its local buckling resistance. \\n5.5.2 Classification \\n(1) Four classes of cross-sections are defined, as follows: \\nClass 1 cross-sections are those which can form a plastic hinge with the rotation capacity required from \\nplastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. \\nClass 2 cross-sections arc those which can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited \\nrotation capacity because of local buckling. \\nClass 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the extreme compression fibre of the steel member \\nassuming an elastic distribution of stresses can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to \\nprevent deve lopment of the plastic moment resistance. \\nClass 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will occur before the attainment of yield stress in \\none or more parts of the cross-section. \\n(2) ]n Class 4 cross sections effective widths may be used to make the necessary allowances for \\nreductions in resistance due to the effects of local buckling, see [§) EN 1993-1-5, 4.4 ®J. \\n(3) The classification of a cross-section depends on the width to thickness ratio of the parts subject to \\ncompreSSiOn. \\n(4) Compression parts include every part of a cross-section which IS either totally or partially 111 \\ncompression under the load combination considered. \\n(5) The various compression parts in a cross-section (such as a web or t1ange) can, in general, be in \\ndifferent classes. \\n(6) A cross-section is classified according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression parts. \\nExceptions are specified in 6.2.1 (10) and 6.2.2.4(1). \\n(7) Alternatively the classification of a cross-section may be defined by quoting both the flange \\nclassification and the web classification. \\n(8) The limiting proportions for Class 1, 2, and 3 compression parts should be obtained from Table 5.2. A \\npart which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4. \\n(9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness \\nratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when £ is increased by \\nfy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e part ta en rom 1rst or er or \\n(J cOIll.Ed \\nwhere necessary second order analysis. \\n40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting \\nproportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2. \\n(11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections \\nwith an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4. \\n(12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending \\nand normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4 \\nsections, depending only on the flange class. \\nNOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5. \\n5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis \\n(1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should \\nhave a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location. \\n(2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the \\nfollowing requirements arc satisfied: \\na) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location; \\nb) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is \\napplied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along \\nthe Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II. \\n(3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria \\nshould be satisfied: \\na) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each \\nway along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web \\nat the plastic hinge location. \\nb) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way \\nalong the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of: \\n2d, where d is as defined in (3)a) \\nthe distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the \\nplastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd. \\ne) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class \\n1, class 2 or class 3. \\n(4) Adjacent to plastic locations, any fastener holes in tension should satisfy 6.2.5(4) for a distance \\nsuch as defined in (3)b) each way along the member from plastic hinge location. \\n(5) For plastic design of a frame, regarding cross section requirements, the capacity of plastic \\nredistribution of moments may be assumed sufficient if the requirements in (2) to (4) are satisfied for all \\nmembers where plastic hinges exist, may occur or have occurred under design loads. \\n(6) In cases where methods of plastic global analysis are used which consider the real stress and strain \\nbehaviour along the member including the combined effect of local, member and global buckling the \\nrequirements (2) to (5) need not be applied. \\n41 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nTable 5.2 (sheet 1 of 3): Maximum width-to-thickness ratios for compression \\nparts \\nInternal compression parts \\n• • ----r \\nc c C I Axis of - - - -\\nJ ------------t+------- -----H-\\nr------C ... c • t ------------- --- --~ \\nClass \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n2 \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n3 \\n£=~235/fy Part subject to \\nbending \\n+ \\ncl t ~ 72£ \\ncit ~ 83£ \\n-------!y --r +// \\n/ c ----I \\n/ c/2 -/L--__ 1 __ -\\'_ \\n~-\\nfy \\ncit ~ 124£ \\nI fv \\nI G I \\nI Part subject to \\ncompression \\ncl t ~ 33£ \\ncl t ~ 38£ \\n+ e \\ni----\\'-\\ncl t ~ 42£ \\n235 275 \\n1,00 0,92 ..,--t .. 1----bending \\n__ 1 \\nt, , \\n+t Axis of --- r~--~ -bending \\nC ... : \\nPali subject to bending and compression \\n+ 1 t lac[ \\nI Ie ~I \\nI ____ t \\nI 396£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\n36£ when a ~ 0,5: cit ~ -\\na \\nI 456£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\nh I 41,5£ w en a ~ 0,5: c t ~ --\\na \\n+ \\nc \\n42£ when \\\\If> -1: cit ~ -----\\n0,67 + 0,33\\\\1f \\nwhen \\\\If ~ -1\"): cit ~ 62£(1 -\\\\If )~ ( -\\\\If) \\n355 420 I 460 \\n0,81 0,75 I 0,71 \\n*) \\\\1\\':::;

Shear buckling effects should also be considered according to EN 1993-1-5. \\n(3) The design values of resistance should depend on the classification of the cross-section. \\n(4) Elastic verification according to the elastic resistance may be carried out for all cross sectional classes \\nprovided the effective cross sectional properties are used for the verification of class 4 cross sections. \\n(5) For the elastic verification the following yield criterion for a critical point of the eross section may be \\nused unless other interaction f01111ulae apply, see 6.2.8 to 6.2.10. \\n(6.1) \\nwhere ax,Ed is the design value of the text deleted longitudinal stress at the point of consideration \\na z.Ed is the design value of the text deleted transverse stress at the point of consideration \\nt Ed is the design value of the 8V text deleted @lI shear stress at the point of consideration \\nNOTE The verification according to (5) can be conservative as it excludes partial plastic stress \\ndistribution, which is permitted in e1astic design. Therefore it should only be performed where the \\ninteraction of on the basis of resistances NRd , MRd , V Rd cannot be performed. \\n45 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(6) The plastic resistance of cross sections should be verified by finding a stress distribution which is in \\nequilibrium with the internal forces and moments without exceeding the yield strength. This stress \\ndistribution should be compatible with the associated plastic deformations. \\n(7) As a conservative approximation for all cross section classes a lincar summation of the utilization \\nratios for cach strcss resultant may be used. For class 1, class 2 or class 3 cross sections subjected to the \\ncombination of , M\\\\.[d and Mz,Ed this method may be applicd by using the following criteria: \\nMz.Ed +--\\nM z.Rd (6.2) \\nwhere NRd , My,Rd and Mz.Rd are the design values of the resistance depending on the cross sectional \\nclassification and including any rcduction that Illay be caused by shear effects, see 6.2.8. \\nNOTE For class 4 cross sections sec 6.2.9.3(2). \\n(8) Wherc all the compression parts of a cross-section are ~ Class 1 or Class 2 @l], the cross-section may \\nbe taken as capable of dcveloping its full plastic resistance in bending. \\n(9) Where all the compression parts of a cross-section are Class 3, its resistance should be based on an \\nclastic distribution of strains across the cross-section. Compressive stresses should be limited to the yield \\nstrength at the extreme fibres. \\nNOTE The extreme fibres may be assumed at the midplane of the t1anges for ULS checks. For \\nfatigue see EN 1993-1-9. \\n(10) Where yiclding first occurs on the tension side of the cross section, the plastic reserves of the tension \\nzone may be utilized by accounting for partial plastification when determining the resistance of a Class 3 \\ncross-section. \\n6.2.2 Section properties \\n6.2.2. t Cross cross-section \\n(1) The properties of the gross cross-section should be determined using the nominal dimensions.

steel structures, has been prepared by Technical\\nCommittee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is\\nresponsible for all Structural Eurocodes.\\nThis European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical\\ntext or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn\\nat latest by March 2010.\\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1.\\nAccording to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the\\nfollowing countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech\\nRepublic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia,\\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn,\\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom.\\nBackground of the Eurocode programme\\nIn 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of\\nconstruction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of\\ntechnical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations.\\nWithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical\\nrules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the\\nnational\\nrules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them.\\nFor fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member\\nStates, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of\\nEuropean codes in the 1980s.\\nIn 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I\\nbetween the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the\\nCEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN).\\nThis links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s\\nDecisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products\\n~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and\\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market).\\nThe Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of\\nParts:\\nEN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design\\nEN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures\\nEN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures\\nEN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures\\nEN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures\\nEN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures\\nEN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures\\nEN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design\\nEN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance\\nI Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation\\n(CEN)\\nconcerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89).\\n5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nEN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures\\nEurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have\\nsafeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these\\ncontinue to vary from State to State.\\nStatus and field of application of Eurocodes\\nThe Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the\\nfonowing purposes:\\nas a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements\\nof Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 -Mechanical resistance and\\nstability -and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire;\\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services;\\nas a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and\\nETAs)\\nThe Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the\\nInterpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from\\nharmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be\\nadequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product\\nstandards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes.\\nThe Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole\\nstructures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of\\nconstruction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be\\nrequired by the designer in such cases.\\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes\\nThe National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any\\nannexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and\\nmay be followed by a National annex (informative).\\nThe National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in\\nthe Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of\\nbuildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. :\\nvalues for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode,\\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~\\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map,\\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode,\\nreferences to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode.\\nLinks between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs\\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in\\ninterpretative documents for the\\ncreation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs.\\nAccording to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall :\\na) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating\\nclasses\\nwhere necessary;\\nb) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of\\ncalculation and technical rules for design. etc. ;\\nc) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals.\\nThe Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2.\\n6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nThere is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products\\nand the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the\\nconstIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined\\nParaIneters have been taken into account.\\nAdditional information specific to EN 1993-1\\nEN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on\\nstructures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to.\\nEN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules\\nintended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules\\napplicable only to buildings.\\nEN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel\\ncomponents, lilnit states or materials.\\nIt may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr\\nmaterials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters.\\nEN 1993-1 is intended for use by\\ncommittees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards,\\nclients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements)\\ndesigners and constructors\\nrelevant authorities\\nNumerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that\\nprovide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of\\nworlananship and quality management applies.\\n4 See Art.3.3 and Art.l2 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.1. 4.3.

A\\npart which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4.\\n(9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness\\nratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when £ is increased by\\nfy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e\\npart ta en rom 1rst or er or\\n(J cOIll.Ed\\nwhere necessary second order analysis.\\n40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\n(10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting\\nproportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2.\\n(11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections\\nwith an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4.\\n(12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending\\nand normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4\\nsections, depending only on the flange class.\\nNOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5.\\n5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis\\n(1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should\\nhave a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location.\\n(2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the\\nfollowing requirements arc satisfied:\\na) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location;\\nb) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is\\napplied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along\\nthe Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II.\\n(3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria\\nshould be satisfied:\\na) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each\\nway along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web\\nat the plastic hinge location.\\nb) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way\\nalong the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of:\\n2d, where d is as defined in (3)a)\\nthe distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the\\nplastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd.\\ne) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class\\n1, class 2 or class 3.\\n(4) Adjacent to plastic locations, any fastener holes in tension should satisfy 6.2.5(4) for a distance\\nsuch as defined in (3)b) each way along the member from plastic hinge location.\\n(5) For plastic design of a frame, regarding cross section requirements, the capacity of plastic\\nredistribution of moments may be assumed sufficient if the requirements in (2) to (4) are satisfied for all\\nmembers where plastic hinges exist, may occur or have occurred under design loads.\\n(6) In cases where methods of plastic global analysis are used which consider the real stress and strain\\nbehaviour along the member including the combined effect of local, member and global buckling the\\nrequirements (2) to (5) need not be applied.\\n41 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nTable 5.2 (sheet 1 of 3): Maximum width-to-thickness ratios for compression\\nparts\\nInternal compression parts\\n• • ----r\\nc c C I Axis of - - - -\\nJ ------------t+------- -----H-\\nr------C ... c • t ------------- --- --~\\nClass\\nStress\\ndistribution\\nin parts\\n( compression\\npositive)\\n2\\nStress\\ndistribution\\nin parts\\n( compression\\npositive)\\n3\\n£=~235/fy Part subject to\\nbending\\n+\\ncl t ~ 72£\\ncit ~ 83£\\n-------!y --r +//\\n/ c ----I\\n/ c/2 -/L--__ 1 __ -\\'_\\n~-\\nfy\\ncit ~ 124£\\nI fv\\nI G I\\nI Part subject to\\ncompression\\ncl t ~ 33£\\ncl t ~ 38£\\n+ e\\ni----\\'-\\ncl t ~ 42£\\n235 275\\n1,00 0,92 ..,--t .. 1----bending\\n__ 1\\nt, ,\\n+t Axis of --- r~--~ -bending\\nC ... :\\nPali subject to bending and compression\\n+ 1 t lac[\\nI Ie ~I\\nI ____ t\\nI 396£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1\\n36£ when a ~ 0,5: cit ~ -\\na\\nI 456£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1\\nh I 41,5£ w en a ~ 0,5: c t ~ --\\na\\n+\\nc\\n42£ when \\\\If> -1: cit ~ -----\\n0,67 + 0,33\\\\1f\\nwhen \\\\If ~ -1\"): cit ~ 62£(1 -\\\\If )~ ( -\\\\If)\\n355 420 I 460\\n0,81 0,75 I 0,71\\n*) \\\\1\\':::;

steel structures, has been prepared by Technical\\nCommittee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is\\nresponsible for all Structural Eurocodes.\\nThis European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical\\ntext or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn\\nat latest by March 2010.\\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1.\\nAccording to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the\\nfollowing countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech\\nRepublic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia,\\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn,\\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom.\\nBackground of the Eurocode programme\\nIn 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of\\nconstruction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of\\ntechnical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations.\\nWithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical\\nrules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the\\nnational\\nrules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them.\\nFor fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member\\nStates, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of\\nEuropean codes in the 1980s.\\nIn 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I\\nbetween the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the\\nCEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN).\\nThis links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s\\nDecisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products\\n~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and\\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market).\\nThe Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of\\nParts:\\nEN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design\\nEN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures\\nEN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures\\nEN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures\\nEN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures\\nEN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures\\nEN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures\\nEN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design\\nEN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance\\nI Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation\\n(CEN)\\nconcerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89).\\n5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nEN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures\\nEurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have\\nsafeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these\\ncontinue to vary from State to State.\\nStatus and field of application of Eurocodes\\nThe Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the\\nfonowing purposes:\\nas a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements\\nof Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 -Mechanical resistance and\\nstability -and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire;\\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services;\\nas a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and\\nETAs)\\nThe Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the\\nInterpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from\\nharmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be\\nadequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product\\nstandards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes.\\nThe Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole\\nstructures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of\\nconstruction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be\\nrequired by the designer in such cases.\\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes\\nThe National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any\\nannexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and\\nmay be followed by a National annex (informative).\\nThe National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in\\nthe Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of\\nbuildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. :\\nvalues for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode,\\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~\\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map,\\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode,\\nreferences to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode.\\nLinks between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs\\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in\\ninterpretative documents for the\\ncreation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs.\\nAccording to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall :\\na) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating\\nclasses\\nwhere necessary;\\nb) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of\\ncalculation and technical rules for design. etc. ;\\nc) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals.\\nThe Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2.\\n6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nThere is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products\\nand the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the\\nconstIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined\\nParaIneters have been taken into account.\\nAdditional information specific to EN 1993-1\\nEN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on\\nstructures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to.\\nEN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules\\nintended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules\\napplicable only to buildings.\\nEN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel\\ncomponents, lilnit states or materials.\\nIt may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr\\nmaterials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters.\\nEN 1993-1 is intended for use by\\ncommittees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards,\\nclients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements)\\ndesigners and constructors\\nrelevant authorities\\nNumerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that\\nprovide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of\\nworlananship and quality management applies.\\n4 See Art.3.3 and Art.l2 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.1. 4.3.

Wherc a plastic hingc\\noccurs in a ll1cmber, thc mcmber cross sections should be double symnlctric or single symmetric with a plane\\nof symmetry in the sanle plane as the rotation of the plastic hinge and it should satisfy thc rcquirements\\nspecified in 5.6. Where a plastic hinge occurs in a joint the joint should either have sufficient strength to\\nensure the hinge remains in the member or should be able to sustain the plastic resistance for a sufficient\\nrotatio11, see EN 1993-1-8.\\n(4)B As a simplified method for a limited plastic redistribution of moments in continuous beams where\\nfollowing an elastic analysis some peak moments exceed the plastic bending resistance of 15 % maximum,\\nthe parts in excess of these peak moments may bc redistributed in any membcr, provided, that:\\na) the internal forces and moments in the framc remain in equilibrium with the applicd loads, and\\nb) all the members in which the moments are reduced have Class 1 or Class 2 cross-sections (sce 5.5), and\\nc) lateral torsional buckling of the members is prevented.\\n5.4.2 Elastic global analysis\\n(1) Elastic global analysis should be based on the assumption that the stress-strain bchaviour of thc\\nmaterial is linear, whatever the stress level is.\\nNOTE For the choice of a semi-continuous joint model see 5.1.2\\n(2) Intemal forces and moments may be calculated according to elastic global analysis cvcn if thc\\nresistance of a cross section is based on its plastic resistance, scc 6.2.\\n(3) Elastic global analysis may also be used for cross sections the resistances of which are limited by local\\nbuckling, see 6.2.\\n5.4.3 Plastic global analysis\\n(l) Plastic global analysis allows for the effects of material non-linearity in calculating thc action cffects\\nof a stnlctural system.

A\\npart which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4.\\n(9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness\\nratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when £ is increased by\\nfy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e\\npart ta en rom 1rst or er or\\n(J cOIll.Ed\\nwhere necessary second order analysis.\\n40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\n(10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting\\nproportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2.\\n(11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections\\nwith an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4.\\n(12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending\\nand normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4\\nsections, depending only on the flange class.\\nNOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5.\\n5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis\\n(1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should\\nhave a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location.\\n(2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the\\nfollowing requirements arc satisfied:\\na) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location;\\nb) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is\\napplied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along\\nthe Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II.\\n(3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria\\nshould be satisfied:\\na) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each\\nway along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web\\nat the plastic hinge location.\\nb) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way\\nalong the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of:\\n2d, where d is as defined in (3)a)\\nthe distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the\\nplastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd.\\ne) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class\\n1, class 2 or class 3.\\n(4) Adjacent to plastic locations, any fastener holes in tension should satisfy 6.2.5(4) for a distance\\nsuch as defined in (3)b) each way along the member from plastic hinge location.\\n(5) For plastic design of a frame, regarding cross section requirements, the capacity of plastic\\nredistribution of moments may be assumed sufficient if the requirements in (2) to (4) are satisfied for all\\nmembers where plastic hinges exist, may occur or have occurred under design loads.\\n(6) In cases where methods of plastic global analysis are used which consider the real stress and strain\\nbehaviour along the member including the combined effect of local, member and global buckling the\\nrequirements (2) to (5) need not be applied.\\n41 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005\\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E)\\nTable 5.2 (sheet 1 of 3): Maximum width-to-thickness ratios for compression\\nparts\\nInternal compression parts\\n• • ----r\\nc c C I Axis of - - - -\\nJ ------------t+------- -----H-\\nr------C ... c • t ------------- --- --~\\nClass\\nStress\\ndistribution\\nin parts\\n( compression\\npositive)\\n2\\nStress\\ndistribution\\nin parts\\n( compression\\npositive)\\n3\\n£=~235/fy Part subject to\\nbending\\n+\\ncl t ~ 72£\\ncit ~ 83£\\n-------!y --r +//\\n/ c ----I\\n/ c/2 -/L--__ 1 __ -\\'_\\n~-\\nfy\\ncit ~ 124£\\nI fv\\nI G I\\nI Part subject to\\ncompression\\ncl t ~ 33£\\ncl t ~ 38£\\n+ e\\ni----\\'-\\ncl t ~ 42£\\n235 275\\n1,00 0,92 ..,--t .. 1----bending\\n__ 1\\nt, ,\\n+t Axis of --- r~--~ -bending\\nC ... :\\nPali subject to bending and compression\\n+ 1 t lac[\\nI Ie ~I\\nI ____ t\\nI 396£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1\\n36£ when a ~ 0,5: cit ~ -\\na\\nI 456£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1\\nh I 41,5£ w en a ~ 0,5: c t ~ --\\na\\n+\\nc\\n42£ when \\\\If> -1: cit ~ -----\\n0,67 + 0,33\\\\1f\\nwhen \\\\If ~ -1\"): cit ~ 62£(1 -\\\\If )~ ( -\\\\If)\\n355 420 I 460\\n0,81 0,75 I 0,71\\n*) \\\\1\\':::;

steel structures, has been prepared by Technical \\nCommittee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is \\nresponsible for all Structural Eurocodes. \\nThis European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical \\ntext or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn \\nat latest by March 2010. \\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. \\nAccording to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the \\nfollowing countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech \\nRepublic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia, \\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn, \\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom. \\nBackground of the Eurocode programme \\nIn 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of \\nconstruction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of \\ntechnical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations. \\nWithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical \\nrules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the national \\nrules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. \\nFor fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member \\nStates, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of \\nEuropean codes in the 1980s. \\nIn 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I \\nbetween the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the \\nCEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). \\nThis links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s \\nDecisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products \\n~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and \\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). \\nThe Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of \\nParts: \\nEN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design \\nEN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures \\nEN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures \\nEN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures \\nEN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures \\nEN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures \\nEN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures \\nEN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design \\nEN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance \\nI Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) \\nconcerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). \\n5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nEN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures \\nEurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have \\nsafeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these \\ncontinue to vary from State to State. \\nStatus and field of application of Eurocodes \\nThe Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the \\nfonowing purposes: \\nas a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements \\nof Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 -Mechanical resistance and \\nstability -and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire; \\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; \\nas a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and \\nETAs) \\nThe Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the \\nInterpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from \\nharmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be \\nadequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product \\nstandards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. \\nThe Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole \\nstructures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of \\nconstruction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be \\nrequired by the designer in such cases. \\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes \\nThe National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any \\nannexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and \\nmay be followed by a National annex (informative). \\nThe National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in \\nthe Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of \\nbuildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : \\nvalues for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode, \\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~ \\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map, \\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode, \\nreferences to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. \\nLinks between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs \\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in interpretative documents for the \\ncreation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs. \\nAccording to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : \\na) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating classes \\nwhere necessary; \\nb) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of \\ncalculation and technical rules for design. etc. ; \\nc) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. \\nThe Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2. \\n6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nThere is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products \\nand the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the \\nconstIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined \\nParaIneters have been taken into account. \\nAdditional information specific to EN 1993-1 \\nEN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on \\nstructures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to. \\nEN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules \\nintended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules \\napplicable only to buildings. \\nEN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel \\ncomponents, lilnit states or materials. \\nIt may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr \\nmaterials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters. \\nEN 1993-1 is intended for use by \\ncommittees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards, \\nclients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements) \\ndesigners and constructors \\nrelevant authorities \\nNumerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that \\nprovide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of \\nworlananship and quality management applies. \\n4 See Art.3.3 and Art.l2 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.1. 4.3.

Thc bchaviour should be modcllcd by one of the following mcthods: \\nby elastic-plastic analysis with plastified scctions and/or joints as plastic hingcs, \\nby non-linear plastic analysis considering the partial plastificatio11 of membcrs in plastic lones, \\nby rigid plastic analysis neglecting thc elastic behaviour betwecn hingcs. \\n(2) Plastic global analysis may be used where the members are capable of sufficicnt rotation capacity to \\nenable the required redistributions ofbcnding Inomcnts to develop, see 5.5 and 5.6. \\n(3) Plastic global analysis should only be used where the stability of members at plastic hinges can be \\nassured, see 6.3.5. \\n(4) The bi-linear stress-strain relationship indicated in Figure 5.8 may be used for thc grades of structural \\nsteel specified in section 3. Altenlatively, a more precise relationship may be adoptcd, see EN 1993-1-5. \\n(J\" \\nFigure 5.8: Bi-linear stress-strain relationship \\n39 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(5) Rigid plastic analysis may be applied if no effects of the deformed geomehy (e.g. second-order \\neffects) have to be considered. Tn this case joints are classified only by strength, see EN 1993-1-8. \\n(6) The effects of deformed geometry of the structure and the structural stability of the frame should be \\nverified according to the principles in 5.2. \\nNOTE The maximum resistance of a frame with significantly deformed geomehy may occur before \\nall hinges of the first order collapse mechanism have fonned. \\n5.5 Classification of cross sections \\n5.5.1 Basis \\n(1) The role of cross section classification is to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation \\ncapacity of cross sections is limited by its local buckling resistance. \\n5.5.2 Classification \\n(1) Four classes of cross-sections are defined, as follows: \\nClass 1 cross-sections are those which can form a plastic hinge with the rotation capacity required from \\nplastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. \\nClass 2 cross-sections arc those which can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited \\nrotation capacity because of local buckling. \\nClass 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the extreme compression fibre of the steel member \\nassuming an elastic distribution of stresses can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to \\nprevent deve lopment of the plastic moment resistance. \\nClass 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will occur before the attainment of yield stress in \\none or more parts of the cross-section. \\n(2) ]n Class 4 cross sections effective widths may be used to make the necessary allowances for \\nreductions in resistance due to the effects of local buckling, see [§) EN 1993-1-5, 4.4 ®J. \\n(3) The classification of a cross-section depends on the width to thickness ratio of the parts subject to \\ncompreSSiOn. \\n(4) Compression parts include every part of a cross-section which IS either totally or partially 111 \\ncompression under the load combination considered. \\n(5) The various compression parts in a cross-section (such as a web or t1ange) can, in general, be in \\ndifferent classes. \\n(6) A cross-section is classified according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression parts. \\nExceptions are specified in 6.2.1 (10) and 6.2.2.4(1). \\n(7) Alternatively the classification of a cross-section may be defined by quoting both the flange \\nclassification and the web classification. \\n(8) The limiting proportions for Class 1, 2, and 3 compression parts should be obtained from Table 5.2. A \\npart which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4. \\n(9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness \\nratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when £ is increased by \\nfy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e part ta en rom 1rst or er or \\n(J cOIll.Ed \\nwhere necessary second order analysis. \\n40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting \\nproportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2. \\n(11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections \\nwith an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4. \\n(12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending \\nand normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4 \\nsections, depending only on the flange class. \\nNOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5. \\n5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis \\n(1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should \\nhave a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location. \\n(2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the \\nfollowing requirements arc satisfied: \\na) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location; \\nb) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is \\napplied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along \\nthe Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II. \\n(3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria \\nshould be satisfied: \\na) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each \\nway along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web \\nat the plastic hinge location. \\nb) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way \\nalong the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of: \\n2d, where d is as defined in (3)a) \\nthe distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the \\nplastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd. \\ne) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class \\n1, class 2 or class 3. \\n(4) Adjacent to plastic locations, any fastener holes in tension should satisfy 6.2.5(4) for a distance \\nsuch as defined in (3)b) each way along the member from plastic hinge location. \\n(5) For plastic design of a frame, regarding cross section requirements, the capacity of plastic \\nredistribution of moments may be assumed sufficient if the requirements in (2) to (4) are satisfied for all \\nmembers where plastic hinges exist, may occur or have occurred under design loads. \\n(6) In cases where methods of plastic global analysis are used which consider the real stress and strain \\nbehaviour along the member including the combined effect of local, member and global buckling the \\nrequirements (2) to (5) need not be applied. \\n41 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nTable 5.2 (sheet 1 of 3): Maximum width-to-thickness ratios for compression \\nparts \\nInternal compression parts \\n• • ----r \\nc c C I Axis of - - - -\\nJ ------------t+------- -----H-\\nr------C ... c • t ------------- --- --~ \\nClass \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n2 \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n3 \\n£=~235/fy Part subject to \\nbending \\n+ \\ncl t ~ 72£ \\ncit ~ 83£ \\n-------!y --r +// \\n/ c ----I \\n/ c/2 -/L--__ 1 __ -\\'_ \\n~-\\nfy \\ncit ~ 124£ \\nI fv \\nI G I \\nI Part subject to \\ncompression \\ncl t ~ 33£ \\ncl t ~ 38£ \\n+ e \\ni----\\'-\\ncl t ~ 42£ \\n235 275 \\n1,00 0,92 ..,--t .. 1----bending \\n__ 1 \\nt, , \\n+t Axis of --- r~--~ -bending \\nC ... : \\nPali subject to bending and compression \\n+ 1 t lac[ \\nI Ie ~I \\nI ____ t \\nI 396£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\n36£ when a ~ 0,5: cit ~ -\\na \\nI 456£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\nh I 41,5£ w en a ~ 0,5: c t ~ --\\na \\n+ \\nc \\n42£ when \\\\If> -1: cit ~ -----\\n0,67 + 0,33\\\\1f \\nwhen \\\\If ~ -1\"): cit ~ 62£(1 -\\\\If )~ ( -\\\\If) \\n355 420 I 460 \\n0,81 0,75 I 0,71 \\n*) \\\\1\\':::;

Shear buckling effects should also be considered according to EN 1993-1-5. \\n(3) The design values of resistance should depend on the classification of the cross-section. \\n(4) Elastic verification according to the elastic resistance may be carried out for all cross sectional classes \\nprovided the effective cross sectional properties are used for the verification of class 4 cross sections. \\n(5) For the elastic verification the following yield criterion for a critical point of the eross section may be \\nused unless other interaction f01111ulae apply, see 6.2.8 to 6.2.10. \\n(6.1) \\nwhere ax,Ed is the design value of the text deleted longitudinal stress at the point of consideration \\na z.Ed is the design value of the text deleted transverse stress at the point of consideration \\nt Ed is the design value of the 8V text deleted @lI shear stress at the point of consideration \\nNOTE The verification according to (5) can be conservative as it excludes partial plastic stress \\ndistribution, which is permitted in e1astic design. Therefore it should only be performed where the \\ninteraction of on the basis of resistances NRd , MRd , V Rd cannot be performed. \\n45 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(6) The plastic resistance of cross sections should be verified by finding a stress distribution which is in \\nequilibrium with the internal forces and moments without exceeding the yield strength. This stress \\ndistribution should be compatible with the associated plastic deformations. \\n(7) As a conservative approximation for all cross section classes a lincar summation of the utilization \\nratios for cach strcss resultant may be used. For class 1, class 2 or class 3 cross sections subjected to the \\ncombination of , M\\\\.[d and Mz,Ed this method may be applicd by using the following criteria: \\nMz.Ed +--\\nM z.Rd (6.2) \\nwhere NRd , My,Rd and Mz.Rd are the design values of the resistance depending on the cross sectional \\nclassification and including any rcduction that Illay be caused by shear effects, see 6.2.8. \\nNOTE For class 4 cross sections sec 6.2.9.3(2). \\n(8) Wherc all the compression parts of a cross-section are ~ Class 1 or Class 2 @l], the cross-section may \\nbe taken as capable of dcveloping its full plastic resistance in bending. \\n(9) Where all the compression parts of a cross-section are Class 3, its resistance should be based on an \\nclastic distribution of strains across the cross-section. Compressive stresses should be limited to the yield \\nstrength at the extreme fibres. \\nNOTE The extreme fibres may be assumed at the midplane of the t1anges for ULS checks. For \\nfatigue see EN 1993-1-9. \\n(10) Where yiclding first occurs on the tension side of the cross section, the plastic reserves of the tension \\nzone may be utilized by accounting for partial plastification when determining the resistance of a Class 3 \\ncross-section. \\n6.2.2 Section properties \\n6.2.2. t Cross cross-section \\n(1) The properties of the gross cross-section should be determined using the nominal dimensions.

steel structures, has been prepared by Technical \\nCommittee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is \\nresponsible for all Structural Eurocodes. \\nThis European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical \\ntext or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn \\nat latest by March 2010. \\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. \\nAccording to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the \\nfollowing countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech \\nRepublic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia, \\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn, \\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom. \\nBackground of the Eurocode programme \\nIn 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of \\nconstruction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of \\ntechnical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations. \\nWithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical \\nrules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the national \\nrules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. \\nFor fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member \\nStates, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of \\nEuropean codes in the 1980s. \\nIn 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I \\nbetween the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the \\nCEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). \\nThis links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s \\nDecisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products \\n~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and \\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). \\nThe Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of \\nParts: \\nEN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design \\nEN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures \\nEN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures \\nEN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures \\nEN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures \\nEN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures \\nEN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures \\nEN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design \\nEN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance \\nI Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) \\nconcerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). \\n5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nEN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures \\nEurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have \\nsafeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these \\ncontinue to vary from State to State. \\nStatus and field of application of Eurocodes \\nThe Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the \\nfonowing purposes: \\nas a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements \\nof Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 -Mechanical resistance and \\nstability -and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire; \\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; \\nas a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and \\nETAs) \\nThe Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the \\nInterpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from \\nharmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be \\nadequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product \\nstandards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. \\nThe Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole \\nstructures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of \\nconstruction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be \\nrequired by the designer in such cases. \\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes \\nThe National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any \\nannexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and \\nmay be followed by a National annex (informative). \\nThe National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in \\nthe Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of \\nbuildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : \\nvalues for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode, \\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~ \\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map, \\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode, \\nreferences to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. \\nLinks between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs \\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in interpretative documents for the \\ncreation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs. \\nAccording to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : \\na) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating classes \\nwhere necessary; \\nb) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of \\ncalculation and technical rules for design. etc. ; \\nc) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. \\nThe Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2. \\n6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nThere is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products \\nand the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the \\nconstIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined \\nParaIneters have been taken into account. \\nAdditional information specific to EN 1993-1 \\nEN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on \\nstructures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to. \\nEN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules \\nintended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules \\napplicable only to buildings. \\nEN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel \\ncomponents, lilnit states or materials. \\nIt may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr \\nmaterials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters. \\nEN 1993-1 is intended for use by \\ncommittees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards, \\nclients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements) \\ndesigners and constructors \\nrelevant authorities \\nNumerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that \\nprovide an acceptable level of reliability.

Wherc a plastic hingc \\noccurs in a ll1cmber, thc mcmber cross sections should be double symnlctric or single symmetric with a plane \\nof symmetry in the sanle plane as the rotation of the plastic hinge and it should satisfy thc rcquirements \\nspecified in 5.6. Where a plastic hinge occurs in a joint the joint should either have sufficient strength to \\nensure the hinge remains in the member or should be able to sustain the plastic resistance for a sufficient \\nrotatio11, see EN 1993-1-8. \\n(4)B As a simplified method for a limited plastic redistribution of moments in continuous beams where \\nfollowing an elastic analysis some peak moments exceed the plastic bending resistance of 15 % maximum, \\nthe parts in excess of these peak moments may bc redistributed in any membcr, provided, that: \\na) the internal forces and moments in the framc remain in equilibrium with the applicd loads, and \\nb) all the members in which the moments are reduced have Class 1 or Class 2 cross-sections (sce 5.5), and \\nc) lateral torsional buckling of the members is prevented. \\n5.4.2 Elastic global analysis \\n(1) Elastic global analysis should be based on the assumption that the stress-strain bchaviour of thc \\nmaterial is linear, whatever the stress level is. \\nNOTE For the choice of a semi-continuous joint model see 5.1.2 \\n(2) Intemal forces and moments may be calculated according to elastic global analysis cvcn if thc \\nresistance of a cross section is based on its plastic resistance, scc 6.2. \\n(3) Elastic global analysis may also be used for cross sections the resistances of which are limited by local \\nbuckling, see 6.2. \\n5.4.3 Plastic global analysis \\n(l) Plastic global analysis allows for the effects of material non-linearity in calculating thc action cffects \\nof a stnlctural system. Thc bchaviour should be modcllcd by one of the following mcthods: \\nby elastic-plastic analysis with plastified scctions and/or joints as plastic hingcs, \\nby non-linear plastic analysis considering the partial plastificatio11 of membcrs in plastic lones, \\nby rigid plastic analysis neglecting thc elastic behaviour betwecn hingcs. \\n(2) Plastic global analysis may be used where the members are capable of sufficicnt rotation capacity to \\nenable the required redistributions ofbcnding Inomcnts to develop, see 5.5 and 5.6. \\n(3) Plastic global analysis should only be used where the stability of members at plastic hinges can be \\nassured, see 6.3.5. \\n(4) The bi-linear stress-strain relationship indicated in Figure 5.8 may be used for thc grades of structural \\nsteel specified in section 3. Altenlatively, a more precise relationship may be adoptcd, see EN 1993-1-5. \\n(J\" \\nFigure 5.8: Bi-linear stress-strain relationship \\n39 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(5) Rigid plastic analysis may be applied if no effects of the deformed geomehy (e.g. second-order \\neffects) have to be considered. Tn this case joints are classified only by strength, see EN 1993-1-8. \\n(6) The effects of deformed geometry of the structure and the structural stability of the frame should be \\nverified according to the principles in 5.2. \\nNOTE The maximum resistance of a frame with significantly deformed geomehy may occur before \\nall hinges of the first order collapse mechanism have fonned. \\n5.5 Classification of cross sections \\n5.5.1 Basis \\n(1) The role of cross section classification is to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation \\ncapacity of cross sections is limited by its local buckling resistance. \\n5.5.2 Classification \\n(1) Four classes of cross-sections are defined, as follows: \\nClass 1 cross-sections are those which can form a plastic hinge with the rotation capacity required from \\nplastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. \\nClass 2 cross-sections arc those which can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited \\nrotation capacity because of local buckling. \\nClass 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the extreme compression fibre of the steel member \\nassuming an elastic distribution of stresses can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to \\nprevent deve lopment of the plastic moment resistance. \\nClass 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will occur before the attainment of yield stress in \\none or more parts of the cross-section. \\n(2) ]n Class 4 cross sections effective widths may be used to make the necessary allowances for \\nreductions in resistance due to the effects of local buckling, see [§) EN 1993-1-5, 4.4 ®J. \\n(3) The classification of a cross-section depends on the width to thickness ratio of the parts subject to \\ncompreSSiOn. \\n(4) Compression parts include every part of a cross-section which IS either totally or partially 111 \\ncompression under the load combination considered. \\n(5) The various compression parts in a cross-section (such as a web or t1ange) can, in general, be in \\ndifferent classes. \\n(6) A cross-section is classified according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression parts. \\nExceptions are specified in 6.2.1 (10) and 6.2.2.4(1). \\n(7) Alternatively the classification of a cross-section may be defined by quoting both the flange \\nclassification and the web classification. \\n(8) The limiting proportions for Class 1, 2, and 3 compression parts should be obtained from Table 5.2. A \\npart which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4. \\n(9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness \\nratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when £ is increased by \\nfy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e part ta en rom 1rst or er or \\n(J cOIll.Ed \\nwhere necessary second order analysis. \\n40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting \\nproportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2. \\n(11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections \\nwith an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4. \\n(12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending \\nand normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4 \\nsections, depending only on the flange class. \\nNOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5. \\n5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis \\n(1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should \\nhave a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location. \\n(2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the \\nfollowing requirements arc satisfied: \\na) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location; \\nb) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is \\napplied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along \\nthe Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II. \\n(3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria \\nshould be satisfied: \\na) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each \\nway along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web \\nat the plastic hinge location. \\nb) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way \\nalong the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of: \\n2d, where d is as defined in (3)a) \\nthe distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the \\nplastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd. \\ne) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class \\n1, class 2 or class 3. \\n(4) Adjacent to plastic locations, any fastener holes in tension should satisfy 6.2.5(4) for a distance \\nsuch as defined in (3)b) each way along the member from plastic hinge location. \\n(5) For plastic design of a frame, regarding cross section requirements, the capacity of plastic \\nredistribution of moments may be assumed sufficient if the requirements in (2) to (4) are satisfied for all \\nmembers where plastic hinges exist, may occur or have occurred under design loads. \\n(6) In cases where methods of plastic global analysis are used which consider the real stress and strain \\nbehaviour along the member including the combined effect of local, member and global buckling the \\nrequirements (2) to (5) need not be applied. \\n41 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\nTable 5.2 (sheet 1 of 3): Maximum width-to-thickness ratios for compression \\nparts \\nInternal compression parts \\n• • ----r \\nc c C I Axis of - - - -\\nJ ------------t+------- -----H-\\nr------C ... c • t ------------- --- --~ \\nClass \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n2 \\nStress \\ndistribution \\nin parts \\n( compression \\npositive) \\n3 \\n£=~235/fy Part subject to \\nbending \\n+ \\ncl t ~ 72£ \\ncit ~ 83£ \\n-------!y --r +// \\n/ c ----I \\n/ c/2 -/L--__ 1 __ -\\'_ \\n~-\\nfy \\ncit ~ 124£ \\nI fv \\nI G I \\nI Part subject to \\ncompression \\ncl t ~ 33£ \\ncl t ~ 38£ \\n+ e \\ni----\\'-\\ncl t ~ 42£ \\n235 275 \\n1,00 0,92 ..,--t .. 1----bending \\n__ 1 \\nt, , \\n+t Axis of --- r~--~ -bending \\nC ... : \\nPali subject to bending and compression \\n+ 1 t lac[ \\nI Ie ~I \\nI ____ t \\nI 396£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\n36£ when a ~ 0,5: cit ~ -\\na \\nI 456£ when a > 0,5: c t ~ ---\\n13a -1 \\nh I 41,5£ w en a ~ 0,5: c t ~ --\\na \\n+ \\nc \\n42£ when \\\\If> -1: cit ~ -----\\n0,67 + 0,33\\\\1f \\nwhen \\\\If ~ -1\"): cit ~ 62£(1 -\\\\If )~ ( -\\\\If) \\n355 420 I 460 \\n0,81 0,75 I 0,71 \\n*) \\\\1\\':::;

Shear buckling effects should also be considered according to EN 1993-1-5. \\n(3) The design values of resistance should depend on the classification of the cross-section. \\n(4) Elastic verification according to the elastic resistance may be carried out for all cross sectional classes \\nprovided the effective cross sectional properties are used for the verification of class 4 cross sections. \\n(5) For the elastic verification the following yield criterion for a critical point of the eross section may be \\nused unless other interaction f01111ulae apply, see 6.2.8 to 6.2.10. \\n(6.1) \\nwhere ax,Ed is the design value of the text deleted longitudinal stress at the point of consideration \\na z.Ed is the design value of the text deleted transverse stress at the point of consideration \\nt Ed is the design value of the 8V text deleted @lI shear stress at the point of consideration \\nNOTE The verification according to (5) can be conservative as it excludes partial plastic stress \\ndistribution, which is permitted in e1astic design. Therefore it should only be performed where the \\ninteraction of on the basis of resistances NRd , MRd , V Rd cannot be performed. \\n45 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n(6) The plastic resistance of cross sections should be verified by finding a stress distribution which is in \\nequilibrium with the internal forces and moments without exceeding the yield strength. This stress \\ndistribution should be compatible with the associated plastic deformations. \\n(7) As a conservative approximation for all cross section classes a lincar summation of the utilization \\nratios for cach strcss resultant may be used. For class 1, class 2 or class 3 cross sections subjected to the \\ncombination of , M\\\\.[d and Mz,Ed this method may be applicd by using the following criteria: \\nMz.Ed +--\\nM z.Rd (6.2) \\nwhere NRd , My,Rd and Mz.Rd are the design values of the resistance depending on the cross sectional \\nclassification and including any rcduction that Illay be caused by shear effects, see 6.2.8. \\nNOTE For class 4 cross sections sec 6.2.9.3(2). \\n(8) Wherc all the compression parts of a cross-section are ~ Class 1 or Class 2 @l], the cross-section may \\nbe taken as capable of dcveloping its full plastic resistance in bending. \\n(9) Where all the compression parts of a cross-section are Class 3, its resistance should be based on an \\nclastic distribution of strains across the cross-section. Compressive stresses should be limited to the yield \\nstrength at the extreme fibres. \\nNOTE The extreme fibres may be assumed at the midplane of the t1anges for ULS checks. For \\nfatigue see EN 1993-1-9. \\n(10) Where yiclding first occurs on the tension side of the cross section, the plastic reserves of the tension \\nzone may be utilized by accounting for partial plastification when determining the resistance of a Class 3 \\ncross-section. \\n6.2.2 Section properties \\n6.2.2. t Cross cross-section \\n(1) The properties of the gross cross-section should be determined using the nominal dimensions.

prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC250 Structural Eurocodes , the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all Structural Eurocodes. This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn at latest by March 2010. This Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. According to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the following countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Background of the Eurocode programme In 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products ~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). The Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts: EN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design EN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures EN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures EN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures EN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures EN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures EN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures EN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design EN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance I Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). 5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) EN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures Eurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these continue to vary from State to State. Status and field of application of Eurocodes The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the fonowing purposes: as a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements of Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N 1 -Mechanical resistance and stability -and Essential Requirement N 2 Safety in case of fire; as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; as a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and ETAs) The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from harmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole structures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases. National Standards implementing Eurocodes The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any annexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex (informative). The National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : values for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode, values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~ geographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map, the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode, references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. Links between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs (\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs. According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : a) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\' \",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating classes where necessary; b) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of calculation and technical rules for design. etc. ; c) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. The Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2. 6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) There is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products and the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the constIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined ParaIneters have been taken into account. Additional information specific to EN 1993-1 EN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on structures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to. EN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules intended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules applicable only to buildings. EN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel components, lilnit states or materials. It may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr materials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters. EN 1993-1 is intended for use by committees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards, clients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements) designers and constructors relevant authorities Numerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of worlananship and quality management applies. 4 See Art.3.3 and Art.l2 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.1. 4.3.

NOTE EN 1090 lists the factors affecting execution that need to be specified during design. (3) Parts sLisceptible to corrosion, mechanical wear or fatigue should be designed such that inspection, maintenance and reconstruction can be carried out satisfactorily and access is available for in-service inspection and maintenance. 28 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (4)8 For building structures no fatigue assessment is normally required except as follows: a) Melnbers supporting lifting appliances or rolling loads b) Members subject to repeated stress cycles from vibrating machinery c) Members subject to wind-induced vibrations d) Members subject to crowd-induced oscillations ~(5)P For elements that cannot be inspected an appropriate corrosion allowance shall be included. @i) (6)B Corrosion protection does not need to be applied to internal building structures, if the internal relative humidity does not exceed 80%). 5 Structural analysis 5.1 Structural modelling for analysis 5.1.1 Structural modelling and basic assumptions ~(l)P Analysis shall be based upon calculation models of the strueture that are appropriate for the limit state under consideration. @i) (2) The calculation model and basic assumptions for the calculations should reflect the structural behaviour at the relevant limit state with appropriate accuracy and reflect the anticipated type of behaviour of the cross sections, members, joints and bearings. ~(3)P The method used for the analysis shall be consistent with the design assumptions. @i) (4)B For the structural modelling and basic assumptions for components of buildings see also EN 1993-1-5 and EN 1993-1-11. 5.1.2 Joint modelling (1) The effects of the behaviour of the joints on the distribution of internal forces and moments within a structure, and on the overall deformations of the structure, may generally be neglected, but where such effects are significant (such as in the case of semi-continuous joints) they should be taken into account, see EN 1993-1-8. (2) To identify whether the effects of joint behaviour on the analysis need be taken into account, a distinction may be made between three joint models as follows, see EN 1993-1-8, 5.1.1 : simple, in which the joint may be assumed not to transll1it bending moments; con6nuous, in which the behaviour of the joint may be assumed to have no effect on the analysis; selni-continuous, in which the behaviour of the joint needs to be taken into account in the analysis (3) The requirements of the various types of joints are given in EN 1993-1-8. 5.1.3 Ground-structure interaction (1) Account should be taken of the deformation characteristics of the supports where significant. NOTE EN 1997 gives guidance for calculation of soil-structure interaction. 29 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) 5.2 Global analysis 5.2.1 Effects of deformed geometry of the structure (I) The internal forces and moments may general1y be determined using either: first-order analysis, using the initial geometry of the structure or second-ordcr analysis, taking into account the influence of the deformation of the structure. (2) The effects of the deformed geometry (second-order effects) should be considered if they increase the action effects significantly or modify significantly the structural behaviour. (3) First order analysis may be used for the structure, if the increase of the relevant internal forces or moments or any other change of structural behaviour caused deformations can be neglected. This condition may be assumed to be fulfilled, if the following criterion is satisfied: Ucr Fer ~ 10 for elastic analysis FEd 2:: 15 for plastic analysis (5.1 ) where Uer is the factor by which the design loading would have to be increased to cause elastic instability in a global mode FEd is the design loading on the structure Fer is the elastic critical buckling load for global instability mode based on initial elastic stiffnesses NOTE A greater limit for Ucr for plastic analysis is given in equation (5.1) because structural behaviour may be significantly influenced by non linear material properties in the ultimate limit state where a frame forms plastic hinges with moment redistributions or where significant non linear deformations from semi-rigid joints occur). Where substantiated by more accurate approaches the National Annex may give a lower limit for Ucr for certain types of frames. (4)B Portal frames with shallow roof slopes and beam-and-column type plane frames in buildings may be checked for sway mode failure with first order analysis if the criterion (5.1) is satisfied for each storey. In thesc structures Uer [ ) should be calculated using the following approximative formula, provided that the axial compression in the beams or rafters is not significant: (5.2) [ ) where is the total design horizontal load, including equivalent forces according to 5.3.2(7), transfelTed by the storey (storey shear) 30 V[d is the total design vertical load on the frame transferred by the storey (storey thrust) @lI b\\'-LEd is the horizontal displacement at the top of the storey, relative to the bottom of the storey, when the frame is loaded with horizontal loads (e.g. wind) and fictitious horizontal loads which arc applied at each floor level h is the storey height h I I I / ~~-~--__ --__ --__ --__ --__ --------~--~~--~r-, I BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) OHEd J I ---1 / I I I / / [ ) Figure 5.1: Notations for 5.2.1 (4) @iI NOTE IS For the application of (4)B in the absence of more detailed information a roof slope may be taken to be shallow if it is not steeper that 1:2 (26 ).

(5) The effects of shear lag and of local buckling on the stiffness should be taken into account if this significantly influences the global analysis, see EN 1993-1-5. NOTE For rolled sections and welded sections with similar dimensions shear lag effects may be neglected. (6) The effects on the global analysis of the slip in bolt holes and similar deformations of connection devices like studs and anchor bolts on action effects should be taken into account, where relevant and significant. 5.2.2 Structural stability of frames (1) If according to 5.2.1 the influence of the deformation of the structure has to be taken into account (2) to (6) should be applied to consider these effects and to verify the structural stability. (2) The verification of the stability of frames or their parts should be carried out considering imperfections and second order effects. (3) According to the type of frame and the global analysis, second order effects and imperfections may be accounted for by one of the following methods: a) both totally by the global analysis, b) partially by the global analysis and partially through individual stability checks of members according to 6.3, c) for basic cases by individual stability checks of equivalent members according to 6.3 using appropriate buckling lengths according to the global buckling mode of the structure. 31 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (4) Second order effccts may be calculated by using an analysis appropriate to the structure (including step-by-step or other itcrative procedures). For frames where the first sway buckling mode is prcdominant first order elastic analysis should be carried out with subsequent amplification of relevant action effects (e.g. bending moments) by appropriate factors. (5)8 For single storey frames designed on the basis of clastic global analysis second order sway effects due to vertical loads may be calculated by increasing the horizontal loads (e.g. wind) and equivalent loads <p due to imperfections (sec 5.3.2(7)) and other possible sway effects according to first order theory by the factor: (5.4 ) U(;r provided that au 3,0, where an may be calculated according to (5.2) in 5.2.1(4)B, provided that the roof slope is shallow and that the axial compression in the beams or rafters is not significant as defined in 5.2.1 (4)B. NOTE B For (Xcr 3,0 a morc accurate second order analysis applies. (6)B For multi-storey frames second order sway cfTects may be calculated by means of the method given in (5)8 provided that all storeys have a similar distribution of vertical loads and distribution of horizontal loads and distribution of frame stiffness with respect to the applied storey shear forces. NOTE B For the limitation of the method see also 5.2.1(4)B. (7) In accordance with (3) the stability of individual members should be checked according to the fo11owing: a) If second order effects in individual members and relevant member imperfections (see 5.3.4) are totally accounted for in the global analysis of the structure, no individual stability check for the members according to 6.3 is necessary. b) If second order effects in individual members or certain individual member imperfections (c.g. member imperfections for flexural and/or lateral torsional buckling, see 5.3.4) are not totally accounted for in the global analysis~ the individual stability of members should be checked according to the relevant criteria in 6.3 for the effects not included in the global analysis. This verification should take account of end moments and forces from the global analysis of the structure, including global second order effects and global imperfections (see 5.3.2) when relevant and may be based on a buckling length equal to the system length (8) Where the stability of a frame is assessed by a check with the equivalent column method according to 6.3 the buckling length values should be based on a global buckling mode of the frame accounting for the stiffness behaviour of members and joints, the presence of plastic hinges and the distribution of compressive forces under the design loads . .In this case intenlal forces to be used in resistance checks are calculated according to first order theory without considering imperfections. NOTE The National Annex may give information on the scope of application. 5.3 Imperfections 5.3.1 Basis (1) Appropriate allowances should be incorporated in the structural analysis to cover the effects of imperfections, including residual stresses and geometrical imperfections such as lack of verticality, lack of 32 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) straightness, lack of flatness, lack of fit eccentricities greater than the essential to1cranccs give in EN 1090-2 present in joints of the unloaded structure. (2) Equivalent geometric imperfections, see 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, should be used, with values which rcflect thc possible effects of all type of imperfections unless these effects are included in the resistance formulae for member design, see section 5.3.4. (3) The following imperfections should be taken into account: a) global imperfections for frames and bracing systcms b) local imperfections for individual members 5.3.2 Imperfections for global analysis of frames (1) The assumed shape of global imperfections and local impcrfections may bc dcrived from the clastic buckling mode of a structure in the plane of buckling considered. (2) Both in and out of plane buckling including torsional buckling with symmetric and asymmetric buckling shapes should be taken into account in the most unfavourable direction and form. (3) For frames sensitive to buckling in a sway mode the effect of imperfections should be allowed for in frame analysis by means of an equivalent imperfection in the form of an initial sway imperfection and individual bow imperfections of members. The imperfections may be determined from: a) global initial sway imperfections, see Figure 5.2: (5.5) where q)o is the basic value: <Po = 1/200 ah is the reduction factor for height h applicable to columns: h is the height of the structure in metcrs am is the reduction factor for the number of columns in a row: am = m is the number of columns in a row including only those columns which carry a vertical load not less than 500/0 of the average value of the column in the vertical plane considcred h Figure 5.2: Equivalent sway imperfections b) relative initial local bow imperfections of members for flexural buckling eo / L where L is the member length h (5.6) NOTE The values Co / L may be chosen in the National Annex.

(10) The possible torsional effects on a structure caused by anti-symmetric sways at the two opposite faces, should also be considered, see Figure 5.5.

(2) For convenience, the effects of the initial bow in1perfections of the members to be restrained by a bracing system, may be replaced by the equivalent stabilizing force as shown in Figure 5.6: 36 eo + c5 8 __ 1} L2 (5.13) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) where <Sq is the inplane deflection of the bracing system due to q plus any external loads calculated from first order analysis NOTE Sq may be taken as 0 if second order theory is used. (3) Where the bracing system is required to stabilize the compression flange of a beam of constant height, the force NEd in Figure 5.6 may be obtained from: NEd = MEd / h (5.14) where MEd is the maximum moment in the beam and h is the overall depth of the beam. NOTE Where a beam is subjected to external compreSSIOn NEd should include a part of the compression force. (4) At points where beams or compression members are spliced, it should also be verified that the bracing system is able to resist a local force equal to amNEd / 100 applied to it by each beam or compression member which is spliced at that point, and to transmit this force to the adjacent points at which that beam or con1pression member is restrained, see Figure 5.7.

In gcneral an additional torsional inlpcrfection need not to be allowed for. NOTE The National Annex may choose the value ofk. The value k 0,5 is recommended. 5.4 Methods of analysis considering material non-linearities 5.4.1 General (1) Thc intcrnal forces and l1101nents may bc determined using eithcr a) elastic global analysis b) plastic global analysis. NOTE For finite element model (FEM) analysis sec EN 1993-1-5. (2) Elastic global analysis may be used in all cases. 38 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (3) Plastic global analysis may be used only where thc structure has sufficient rotation capacity at thc actual locations of the plastic hinges, whether this is in the membcrs or in thc joints. Wherc a plastic hingc occurs in a ll1cmber, thc mcmber cross sections should be double symnlctric or single symmetric with a plane of symmetry in the sanle plane as the rotation of the plastic hinge and it should satisfy thc rcquirements specified in 5.6. Where a plastic hinge occurs in a joint the joint should either have sufficient strength to ensure the hinge remains in the member or should be able to sustain the plastic resistance for a sufficient rotatio11, see EN 1993-1-8. (4)B As a simplified method for a limited plastic redistribution of moments in continuous beams where following an elastic analysis some peak moments exceed the plastic bending resistance of 15 % maximum, the parts in excess of these peak moments may bc redistributed in any membcr, provided, that: a) the internal forces and moments in the framc remain in equilibrium with the applicd loads, and b) all the members in which the moments are reduced have Class 1 or Class 2 cross-sections (sce 5.5), and c) lateral torsional buckling of the members is prevented. 5.4.2 Elastic global analysis (1) Elastic global analysis should be based on the assumption that the stress-strain bchaviour of thc material is linear, whatever the stress level is. NOTE For the choice of a semi-continuous joint model see 5.1.2 (2) Intemal forces and moments may be calculated according to elastic global analysis cvcn if thc resistance of a cross section is based on its plastic resistance, scc 6.2. (3) Elastic global analysis may also be used for cross sections the resistances of which are limited by local buckling, see 6.2. 5.4.3 Plastic global analysis (l) Plastic global analysis allows for the effects of material non-linearity in calculating thc action cffects of a stnlctural system. Thc bchaviour should be modcllcd by one of the following mcthods: by elastic-plastic analysis with plastified scctions and/or joints as plastic hingcs, by non-linear plastic analysis considering the partial plastificatio11 of membcrs in plastic lones, by rigid plastic analysis neglecting thc elastic behaviour betwecn hingcs. (2) Plastic global analysis may be used where the members are capable of sufficicnt rotation capacity to enable the required redistributions ofbcnding Inomcnts to develop, see 5.5 and 5.6. (3) Plastic global analysis should only be used where the stability of members at plastic hinges can be assured, see 6.3.5. (4) The bi-linear stress-strain relationship indicated in Figure 5.8 may be used for thc grades of structural steel specified in section 3. Altenlatively, a more precise relationship may be adoptcd, see EN 1993-1-5. (J\" Figure 5.8: Bi-linear stress-strain relationship 39 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (5) Rigid plastic analysis may be applied if no effects of the deformed geomehy (e.g. second-order effects) have to be considered. Tn this case joints are classified only by strength, see EN 1993-1-8. (6) The effects of deformed geometry of the structure and the structural stability of the frame should be verified according to the principles in 5.2. NOTE The maximum resistance of a frame with significantly deformed geomehy may occur before all hinges of the first order collapse mechanism have fonned. 5.5 Classification of cross sections 5.5.1 Basis (1) The role of cross section classification is to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation capacity of cross sections is limited by its local buckling resistance. 5.5.2 Classification (1) Four classes of cross-sections are defined, as follows: Class 1 cross-sections are those which can form a plastic hinge with the rotation capacity required from plastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. Class 2 cross-sections arc those which can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited rotation capacity because of local buckling. Class 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the extreme compression fibre of the steel member assuming an elastic distribution of stresses can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to prevent deve lopment of the plastic moment resistance. Class 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will occur before the attainment of yield stress in one or more parts of the cross-section. (2) ]n Class 4 cross sections effective widths may be used to make the necessary allowances for reductions in resistance due to the effects of local buckling, see [ ) EN 1993-1-5, 4.4 J. (3) The classification of a cross-section depends on the width to thickness ratio of the parts subject to compreSSiOn. (4) Compression parts include every part of a cross-section which IS either totally or partially 111 compression under the load combination considered. (5) The various compression parts in a cross-section (such as a web or t1ange) can, in general, be in different classes. (6) A cross-section is classified according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression parts. Exceptions are specified in 6.2.1 (10) and 6.2.2.4(1). (7) Alternatively the classification of a cross-section may be defined by quoting both the flange classification and the web classification. (8) The limiting proportions for Class 1, 2, and 3 compression parts should be obtained from Table 5.2. A part which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4. (9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness ratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when is increased by fy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e part ta en rom 1rst or er or (J cOIll.Ed where necessary second order analysis. 40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting proportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2. (11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections with an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4. (12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending and normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4 sections, depending only on the flange class. NOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5. 5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis (1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should have a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location. (2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the following requirements arc satisfied: a) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location; b) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is applied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along the Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II. (3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria should be satisfied: a) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each way along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web at the plastic hinge location. b) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way along the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of: 2d, where d is as defined in (3)a) the distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the plastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd. e) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class 1, class 2 or class 3.

The following numerical values are recommended for buildings: YMO 1,00 YMI = ] ,00 YM2 = 1,25 6.2 Resistance of cross-sections 6.2.1 General 1Ei>(1)P The design value of an action effect in each eross section shall not exceed the corresponding design resistance and if several action effects act simultaneously the combined effect shaH not exeeed the resistance for that combination. @il (2) Shear lag effects and local buekling effects should be included by an effective width according to EN 1993-1-5. Shear buckling effects should also be considered according to EN 1993-1-5. (3) The design values of resistance should depend on the classification of the cross-section. (4) Elastic verification according to the elastic resistance may be carried out for all cross sectional classes provided the effective cross sectional properties are used for the verification of class 4 cross sections. (5) For the elastic verification the following yield criterion for a critical point of the eross section may be used unless other interaction f01111ulae apply, see 6.2.8 to 6.2.10.

Therefore it should only be performed where the interaction of on the basis of resistances NRd , MRd , V Rd cannot be performed. 45 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (6) The plastic resistance of cross sections should be verified by finding a stress distribution which is in equilibrium with the internal forces and moments without exceeding the yield strength. This stress distribution should be compatible with the associated plastic deformations. (7) As a conservative approximation for all cross section classes a lincar summation of the utilization ratios for cach strcss resultant may be used. For class 1, class 2 or class 3 cross sections subjected to the combination of , M\\\\.[d and Mz,Ed this method may be applicd by using the following criteria: Mz.Ed +-- M z.Rd (6.2) where NRd , My,Rd and Mz.Rd are the design values of the resistance depending on the cross sectional classification and including any rcduction that Illay be caused by shear effects, see 6.2.8. NOTE For class 4 cross sections sec 6.2.9.3(2). (8) Wherc all the compression parts of a cross-section are ~ Class 1 or Class 2 @l], the cross-section may be taken as capable of dcveloping its full plastic resistance in bending. (9) Where all the compression parts of a cross-section are Class 3, its resistance should be based on an clastic distribution of strains across the cross-section. Compressive stresses should be limited to the yield strength at the extreme fibres. NOTE The extreme fibres may be assumed at the midplane of the t1anges for ULS checks. For fatigue see EN 1993-1-9. (10) Where yiclding first occurs on the tension side of the cross section, the plastic reserves of the tension zone may be utilized by accounting for partial plastification when determining the resistance of a Class 3 cross-section. 6.2.2 Section properties 6.2.2. t Cross cross-section (1) The properties of the gross cross-section should be determined using the nominal dimensions. Holes for fasteners need not be deducted, but allowance should be made for larger openings. Splice materials should not be included. 6.2.2.2 Net area (1) The net area of a cross-sect jon should be taken as its gross area less appropriate deductions for all holes and other openings.

For countersunk holes, appropriate allowance should be made for the countersunk portion. (3) Provided that the fastener holes are not staggered, the total area to be deducted for fastener holes should be the maximum sum of the sectional areas of the holes in any cross-section perpendicular to the member axis (see failure plane (?) in Figure 6.1).

This paper evaluates the relative\\ncapabilities of three surrogate modeling approaches to estimate seismic loss under complete and incomplete\\ndesign information scenarios. Three surro - gate models of knowledge-based (i.e., from prior published\\nassessments), data-driven (i.e., support vector ma- chine trained on a simulation-based building inventory),\\nand physics-based (i.e., equivalent single-degree-of- freedom systems) are systematically used to estimate\\nbounds on direct seismic loss for four hypothetical con- crete office construction projects in Charleston,\\nSouth Carolina. Subsequently, a framework is presented that implements these surrogate models as a sequence to\\nexplore design alternatives consistent with divergence- convergence cycles of early design exploration. The\\nresults show that all different surrogate models provide reasonable accuracy for the complete design\\ninformation case, whereas data-driven models provided higher accuracy than the other models. For incomplete\\ndesign information, the data-driven models demarcated the performance space and estimated the same median loss\\nvalues as detailed loss analysis. In contrast, physics- based surrogate models were more accurate in capturing\\nthe relationship between loss and design parameters for smaller sets of design alternatives. Nevertheless, all\\ndifferent surrogate modeling techniques were inadequate to capture loss variability between different designs\\nof the same geometry. 1.Introduction Early design is the process of formulating a design problem, col- lecting\\nand contextualizing data, and progressively addressing the identified issues. For modern construction, early\\ndesign becomes an interdisciplinary multi-faceted problem [1] that integrates conventional architectural\\nthinking with various objectives such as environmental performance [2,3] , energy efficiency [4], structural\\nsafety and integrity, and long-term performance [5]. The recent interest in improving resil- iency calls for\\nearly design frameworks that ensure the selected mate- rials, subsystems, and topologies will lead to high-\\nperforming design with respect to natural hazard impact [6 8]. A performance-based early design framework\\n(PBED) [9] aims to improve early design by integrating the hazard-related expertise of structural engineers\\ninto an architect-led design process. PBED quan- tifies different design alternatives life-cycle structural\\nperformance across multiple performance domains, such as natural hazards and environmental impacts. Estimating\\nstructural response to natural hazards is the most time- and computational- intensive step in PBED, as\\nsophisticated analytical models must describe the system s entire life cycle. For example, to evaluate\\nstructures life-cycle performance under earthquakes, these analytical models should be subjected to a ground\\nmotion suite representing different ground shaking intensities to ac- count for the record-to-record\\nvariability [10 12]. Insufficient and imprecise information on building footprint, topol - ogy, and material\\ntype renders performing performance-based seismic assessments cumbersome, if not infeasible, in early design.\\nTherefore, PBED uses surrogate models that can be evaluated faster than the detailed analytical model with\\nreasonable accuracy [13]. The applica - tion of surrogate models in early seismic design poses questions on\\ntheir suitability for generating insights in the presence of limited information. However, the literature on\\nthe feasibility of surrogate models is domi - nated by detailed design [14,15] . A review of different\\nsurrogate modeling approaches for seismic design and assessments is presented in Section 2. Two crucial issues\\nremain if an argument can be made on the *Corresponding author. E-mail address: mohsen.zaker@usu.edu (M. Zaker\\nEsteghamati).

First, various surrogate modeling techniques are available, and their\\nadvantages and limitations with respect to performance estimation under different design infor- mation levels\\nare not well-understood. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how different surrogate models balance\\ncomputational ease, the designer s effort and time, and estimation accuracy at early design. Second, a\\nframework is needed to overcome the inherent limitations of various models, and maximize surrogate models\\nusefulness by sys- tematically integrating each surrogate type in the alternating cycles of early design. This\\npaper compares the relative capabilities of different surrogate modeling techniques to directly estimate\\nseismic loss under complete and incomplete design information. Here, the incomplete scenario refers to only\\nthe availability of the building s overall geometry (e.g., height, footprint) and selected lateral-resisting\\nsystems, whereas the complete scenario indicates the availability of all relevant design information, such as\\nmember sizing. The results of the comparative study are then used to propose a systematic approach that\\nimplements the discussed surrogate models sequentially in performance-based early design exploration. In the\\nproposed sequential framework, the lower fidelity models are assigned to initial steps to deal with a large\\ndesign space, and as the design evolves, surrogate models with higher computational needs are employed to\\nassess reduced design space. Each prior model constrains the input space for the posterior model to reduce the\\noverall computational cost and guide the exploration of design space. To illus- trate the framework s\\napplication, knowledge-based, data-driven, and physics-based surrogate models are developed for a case study\\nof mid- rise concrete frame projects with fixed footprints and location. The or- ganization of this paper is\\nas follows: Section 2 reviews the literature for each class of surrogate modeling techniques used in this\\nstudy. Section 3 describes the illustrative example and develops individual surrogate models for complete and\\nincomplete design information scenarios. Section 4 describes the sequential framework and demonstrates its\\napplication for the case study. Lastly, the results of the sequential framework are compared to the individual\\nsurrogate models predictions. 2.Literature review 2.1. Knowledge-based surrogate models Performance-based\\nseismic assessment data (i.e., PBEE) are rarely structured to be reusable, resulting in significant gaps in\\ncomprehensive knowledge-based surrogate modeling. Here, knowledge-based is loosely used to refer to all\\nmethods of extracting human expert knowledge and encoding them in an algorithm or digital product, such as\\nliterature- based discovery [16], ontology-based information extraction [17], and natural language processing\\n[18]. The majority of limited efforts are aimed at developing databases for regional vulnerability models\\n[19], such as GEM [20] and HAZUS [21]. As structured open databases emerge, developing knowledge-based\\nsurrogate models becomes increasingly accessible. Omoya et al. developed a relational database that provides\\nactual building damage and recovery data from the 2014 Napa Earthquake [22]. Guan et al. developed a database\\nof seismic design and nonlinear models of 621 special steel moment frames generated by an automated\\ncomputational framework. Additionally, they provided time history assessments for a subset of 100 frames\\nsubjected to 140 ground motion records for future data mining applications. However, the dataset is not\\nstructured for easy querying [23]. Recently, Esteghamati et al. devel - oped a relational database of existing\\nliterature on performance-based seismic assessment of buildings. This database contains information on 222\\nmid-rise building seismic assessments from the US, Europe, and Asia [24]. Additional tools for querying the\\ndatabase are also provided in a public repository [25]. Nevertheless, the database does not provide loss\\nassessment values and supports a limited number of building topologies and site locations. 2.2. Data-driven\\nsurrogate models The literature on data-driven surrogate models is focused on map- ping high-level feature\\nspace to structural response [26 29]. Here data- driven refers to all statistical learning methods (e.g.,\\nregression, artificial neural networks) employed to predict the seismic response based on structural system\\nproperties without performing dynamic analysis. Among the limited literature on building seismic performance,\\nefforts have been made for concrete frames [30 32], steel frames [33,34], infilled concrete frames [35], and\\nrocking braced frames [36,37]. These studies use detailed structural parameters (e.g., ductility parameters,\\nmembers strength) and ground motion characteristics (e.g., intensity measures, direction) to predict\\nstructural peak responses or fragility functions for limited case study buildings. A complete review of\\nstudies aimed at predicting structural response using data-driven surrogate models can be found in Sun et al.\\n[38]. Moving toward generalizable surrogate models, a notable work by Guan et al. developed ensemble-based and\\nhybrid statistical methods to estimate drift demands of steel moment frames [39]. Among the few works\\nexplicitly aimed at early design, Esteghamati and Flint developed a simulation-based inventory to train\\ngeneralizable surrogate models for mid-rise concrete frame office buildings using crude topology and design\\nparameters. They concluded that support vector machines could reasonably estimate total loss using only\\nestimable parameters such as floor area, height, and frame weight for a fixed location [13]. 2.3. Physics-\\nbased surrogate models A large body of research proposed different physics-based (i.e., mechanistic or\\nphenomenological) surrogate models, such as shear and flexural beam theory [40], and equivalent single-degree-\\nof-freedom (SDOF) systems [41]. Historically, SDOF systems are assumed to be a reasonably accurate\\napproximation for building systems dominated by a single mode. One of the earliest studies by Gupta and\\nKrawinkler laid the foundation for estimating inter-story drift of frame structures from equivalent SDOFs\\ndisplacement. Although the SDOF accuracy varied based on the number of stories and ground motion\\ncharacteristics, it was deemed a valuable tool for early design [42]. Vamvatsikos and Cornell introduced the\\nSPO2IDA methodology, which uses the equivalent SDOF concept to relate static pushover of buildings to traces\\nof incremental dynamic analysis [43,44]. SPO2IDA Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of different surrogate\\nmodels for early design. Surrogate type Advantages Disadvantages Knowledge- based models Requires minimum\\ninformation and analysis on behalf of the designer [48], suitable for unstructured problems limited open-\\nsource databases, lack of transparent and structured methodologies [49] to link generic data to site- specific\\nstudies, challenges in integrating complex rules [50] Data-driven models Ease of use, flexibility, no\\nassumption on response and input relationship [38,51], increased design diversity [52] Often specific to the\\ncase study derived from (i.e., generalizability issues)[53], require additional details on building\\ndesign[38], different suggested algorithms, challenging interpretation (i. e., black-box models) [54],\\nunavailability of training data [55] Physics-based/ mechanistic models Physical interpretation [39],\\nextrapolation capabilities [56] Accuracy concerns [57], the subjectivity of empirical coefficients to map\\nbuildings dynamic characteristics to reduced-order model, requires additional structural analysis M. Zaker\\nEsteghamati and M.M. Flint Engineering Structures 286 (2023) 116098 3inspired numerous extensions and\\napplications. Baltzopoulos et al. developed SPO2Frag, which directly links pushover curves to fragility curves\\n[45]. Nafeh et al. extended the SPO2IDA methodology to accommodate the particular backbone shape of concrete\\nframes with infilled masonry [46]. Recently, Vaseghiamiri et al. developed Bayesian regression models to\\nderive SDOF backbone parameters for steel multistory frames considering modeling uncertainties. They showed\\nthat the developed SDOFs could accurately capture roof drift ratios, even for frames with different designs\\nused to derive regression models [47]. As these physics-based surrogate models are applied to case study\\nbuildings to derive performance, one might consider structuring their results as a knowledge-based repository\\nfor future early design applications. 2.4. Research gaps The reviewed literature shows the following gaps in\\nusing surrogate modeling for a performance-based early design: 1. A small portion of already limited\\nliterature addresses early design. Therefore, there is a concern about whether these surrogate methods provide\\nuseful information in the presence of limited data. 2. As shown in Table 1, significant advantages and\\ndisadvantages exist for each surrogate modeling type, and the tradeoff between different models accuracy,\\nrequired information, and ease of implementation has not been thoroughly investigated. 3.The depth of\\nliterature on different surrogate varies. Therefore, sig- nificant hurdles exist in implementing each method\\nin a real-world project. A systematic approach is needed to utilize and comple - ment different modeling\\ntechniques to explore early design space. To address these shortcomings, this study has three main objectives:\\n(a) evaluate the accuracy of various surrogate modeling techniques to estimate hazard performance measures,\\n(b) assess the effect of design information availability on the accuracy of these models, (c) propose a\\nsystematic approach to integrate these surrogate models for a low-cost and accurate performance-based design\\nspace exploration. 3.Illustrative example This section first describes an early design scenario. Next, it\\ndiscusses the development of knowledge-, data-driven-, and physics-based surro - gate models for two cases of\\n(i) incomplete data: where only the topology of the buildings is known (i.e., building footprint and height),\\nand (ii) complete data: where the design information (complete information beams and columns section sizes and\\nreinforcement) is available. The former case represents the incomplete knowledge state of the early design,\\nwhereas the latter targets the more detailed design stage. Fig. 1 shows the general methodology of this study,\\nwhereas Table 2 specifies the used data, input, and output for each surrogate model.

Early design scenario A structural engineer is consulted to\\nestimate the life-cycle seismic performance of a concrete frame as a candidate lateral-resisting system for\\nfour office building projects. As shown in Fig. 2, office A is a 6-story building with six 30- feet (9.14 m)\\nbays in both directions, office B is a 5- story building with three and five 30-feet bays in each direction,\\noffice C is another 5-story building with four and five 27-feet (8.2 m) bays in each direction, and lastly,\\noffice D is a 4-story concrete frame with five 27-feet bays (8.2 m) in both directions. As shown in Fig. 2,\\nall building projects are assumed to be located on an identical site in Charleston, South Carolina, USA\\n(32.722105, \\x0079.93408), where they are subjected to high seismicity hazard (SDS 0B75 g and SD1 0B38 g for site\\nclass B/ C boundary). The building topologies are selected based on current literature to investigate complete\\nand incomplete design cases in the next section. The 4-story building represents typical archetype buildings\\nstudied in the literature, whereas the 6-story building acts as an upper bound on available information from\\nthe literature. The 5-story building with 30 bays represents an intermediate topology between upper and lower\\nbound topologies. Lastly, the 5-story building with 27-feet bays has the same gross area as the 4-story\\nbuilding, hence it allows for examining whether different surrogate models can distinguish between buildings\\nwith a similar gross area and different topologies. For the remainder of this paper, the building topologies\\nare referred to by the number of stories (m) and bay length (n) in the format of ms-n; For example, 6 s-30\\ndenotes the 6-story building with 30 bays. 3.1.1.

These design variations also provide\\ndata to derive data-driven (e.g., weight) and physics-based (e.g., base shear-roof drift relationship and mass\\nfactor) surrogate models for the complete data case. The 32 design variations were obtained by assigning\\ndifferent rein- forced concrete section sizes to frame members that meet the code s minimum and maximum\\nlongitudinal and transverse reinforcement re- quirements. Finite element models of these frames were then\\ndeveloped in OpenSees [58] and subjected to 20 site-specific ground motions scaled to the site s Maximum\\nConsidered Earthquake (MCE) level, as described in Appendix I. The structural responses were checked against\\nthe ASCE 7 code s [59] requirements on collapse (no more than two collapse cases) and maximum drift values\\n(less than 4% interstory drift values). Addi- tional information on design alternatives modeling can be found\\nin Appendix I. It should be noted that the design variations represent hy- pothetical buildings that meet the\\nglobal life safety objective, instead of a careful design that precisely meet all different requirements\\n(e.g., constructability, wind design, panel zone shear checks). Lastly, seismic loss values are derived for\\neach design variation following the approach briefly described in Appendix I. Seismic loss is quantified using\\nexpected annual loss (EAL) in terms of repair cost after an earthquake during the building service life of 50\\nyears. EAL accounts for all the possible seismic hazard levels at the site, and hence, emphasizes the losses\\ndue to more frequent events [60]. Additional information on reference alternatives and loss methodology can be\\nfound in [13]. 3.2. Surrogate models development using incomplete data In this section, the three types of\\nsurrogate models are developed using only crude geometric information for the described concrete buildings in\\nSection 3.1. These surrogate models use buildings height and footprint from the project description and\\nsupplement the remain - ing information from published literature as discussed in the following. 3.2.1.\\nKnowledge-based surrogate modeling A literature review, including a query on the INSSEPT database [25], was\\nperformed to identify mid-rise concrete moment frames with similar geometry as the studied buildings. Table 3\\nreports the value extracted from the papers and the INSSEPT database. Due to the shortage of full performance-\\nbased assessments, the available literature often does not provide results from buildings with similar\\ngeometry (e.g., floor area, height) and design processes (e.g., building codes, different seismic hazard\\nlevels). Furthermore, the lack of adequate PBEE assessments for Charleston exacerbates the issue, as the\\navailable buildings for sites with similar seismicity (i.e., Eastern US) are not designed to withstand Seismic\\nloads. These differences result in a considerably different performance. Several remedies are used to\\nalleviate the non-specificity of assess - ment results. Efforts are made only to select concrete frame\\nbuildings with similar geometry (e.g., mid-rise, regular frames). Also, whenever seismic demand and collapse\\ndata were available, fragility curves were derived based on the HAZUS guideline [61] for structural and non-\\nstructural components, following the approach discussed in Appendix II. These fragility curves were then\\nintegrated with Charleston hazard data to calculate the expected annual loss. If the demand model data was\\nunavailable, the reported normalized values (in terms of percentage of building cost) were directly used. All\\nnormalized expected loss values were multiplied by the RC construction cost in Charleston to derive monetary\\nvalues. Fig. 3 shows the derived expected annual loss and corresponding regression-based surrogate models.\\nData is grouped into three different groups based on the site s seismicity and post-processing levels: sites\\nwith similar seismicity (the Central Eastern US) modified based on Charleston hazard data, sites with higher\\nseismicity which their loss values are not modified, and lastly, unaltered loss values from sites with lower\\nseismicity. As shown in Fig. 3, the studied archetype buildings are expected to fall into the shaded area. It\\nshould be noted that concrete buildings located in a site with different seismicity are proportioned to resist\\na different lateral load level and provide disparate ductility and strength. Furthermore, the expected loss\\n(even when modified) is derived from subjecting the original structure to ground motion records suitable for\\nthe corresponding study s site. Therefore, the results are only treated as upper and lower bounds on estimated\\nperformance Fig. 3.Estimating performance range (shaded area) using knowledge-based surrogate models: markers\\nshow individual studies, whereas dashed lines are fitted bounds.

Flint Engineering\\nStructures 286 (2023) 116098 6rather than an accurate approximation. 3.2.2. Data-driven surrogate modeling A\\npreviously developed support vector machine regression (SVR) model [13] is used to derive seismic loss for the\\nconsidered buildings. The SVR model is specifically developed to be applicable in early design, where (i) only\\na few crude input parameters are required that are either available or estimable by the user, and (ii) loss is\\ndirectly predicted, so no intermediate calculations are needed. Furthermore, the SVR is trained on a\\nvulnerability inventory comprising concrete frames located in Charleston. Thus there is an excellent agreement\\nbetween data uti- lized in SVR development and the current project s taxonomy. The ac- curacy of SVR models\\nwas assessed based on root-mean squared error (RMSE) of testing set. RMSE measures the second sample moment of\\nthe deviation between predicted and observed values (i.e., residuals), providing an efficient means to assess\\nthe performance of regression- based models. Two variations of the developed SVR were implemented: (1) a full\\nmodel which uses building height, transverse dimension, floor area, lateral-resisting frame weight, average\\nbeam area, average beam area at the first floor, and average beam reinforcement ratio, and (2) a reduced model\\nwhich uses building height, building dimension in the transverse direction, floor area and weight of lateral\\nframes at the expense of lower accuracy. For the studied buildings, height and floor area are known, and the\\nuser needs to roughly estimate four and one other parameters for the full and reduced models, respectively. It\\nis expected that a user without extensive prior experience can provide an array of input vari- ables to\\napproximately demarcate the performance space. Fig. 4 shows the predicted seismic loss using full and reduced\\nSVR models for the building topologies. Here, the user demarcates perfor - mance space based on the assumed\\nminimum and maximum values for each of the seven input parameters. In addition, a random sample of 1000\\nadditional designs with the same geometry but different beam designs and lateral weight values are generated\\nto cover the perfor - mance space. The estimated loss from the reduced model is shown as overlaid thick lines\\nin Fig. 4. The full data-driven models in Fig. 4 suggest that the 6-story building (i.e., 6 s-30) has the\\nhighest loss regardless of its design. In addition, the estimated loss for the 5-story buildings (i.e., 5 s-30\\nand 5 s-27) overlaps, and is in a similar range to the 4-story building. Furthermore, the esti- mated loss\\nreduces by the increase in the lateral weight. The predicted loss by reduced models lies within the prediction\\nplane by the full model. However, the exclusion of beam design parameters introduces additional epistemic\\nuncertainty, resulting in the lack of information on loss variability with respect to lateral weight. Reduced\\ndata-driven models suggest that the 6-story building has the highest loss. In addi- tion, the two buildings\\nwith a similar gross area (i.e., 5 s-27 and 4 s-27) have similar performance range within the same range of\\nlateral weight, albeit 5 s-27 has a slightly higher loss for frames with lateral weight above 400 tons. 3.2.3.\\nPhysics-based surrogate modeling There are several methods to map a building s dynamic response to an\\nequivalent SDOF. This study assumes that the equivalent SDOF s response to monotonic load (i.e., backbone\\ncurve) is defined by a trilinear force deformation [62]. As mentioned in Section 2, physics- based models\\nrequire building dynamic information. Here, static push- over analyses are extracted from literature [63 65]\\nto estimate the base shear (V) - roof displacement (D). The extracted pushover curves are from buildings\\nlocated in sites with different seismicity. Therefore, additional pushover curves are generated to serve as\\nthe lower\\\\upper bound V-D relationships, where the initial pushover curve is uniformly scaled by the ratio of\\ndesign acceleration between Charleston and the selected study site. The V-D relationship is then scaled by the\\nfirst mode participation factor and mapped to the equivalent SDOF force (F) displacement ( ) by balancing the\\narea under the transformed scaled V-D relationship as shown in Fig. 5.a and 5.b. Based on prior research, a\\npeak-oriented hysteretic model with a cyclic deterioration parameter of 50 is adop- ted [62]. The SDOF is then\\nsubjected to 80 site-specific ground motion records, and its displacement is recorded. The estimated\\ndisplacement is converted to inter-story drift values using empirical values suggested by Gupta and Krawinkler\\n[42]. The drift responses are then translated to loss values following the same loss approach described in\\nAppendix II, consistent with other surrogate modeling approaches and point-of- reference detailed assessments.\\nDue to the lack of well-documented pushover studies on 5-story concrete buildings, this approach is only\\napplied to 4- and 6-story buildings. As shown in Fig. 5.c, equivalent SDOFs distinguish between loss values of\\nthe two corresponding topologies, where the 6-story has a larger median loss value than the 4-story buildings.\\nFurthermore, the scaling procedure results in larger loss variability for the 6-story build - ing than for the\\n4-story building. Fig. 5.c shows that the reported total weight of the 6-story from reference [64] is smaller\\nthan the 4-story building, possibly due to the smaller floor area. 3.3. Surrogate modeling using complete data\\nThis section develops the three discussed surrogate modeling types based on an inventory of analytical models\\nof buildings, and compares the predicted loss values to ones from detailed models. A summary of models data,\\ninput, and output is provided in Table 2. 3.3.1. Knowledge-based surrogate modeling A performance inventory\\n(used in developing data-driven models in [13]) was explored to obtain a knowledge-based surrogate model using\\nFig. 5.Static pushover curves and the corresponding idealized SDOF of (a) 6-story building, (b) 4- story\\nbuilding from literature. (c) prediction loss values of SDOFs. M. Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint Engineering\\nStructures 286 (2023) 116098 7buildings from a similar site and design. The inventory comprises mid- rise\\nconcrete frame buildings with different gross areas in Charleston, hence, it has excellent agreement with the\\nreference buildings. Fig. 6 shows the compiled inventory and the regression-based surrogate model. Compared to\\nFig. 2, the inventory has a significantly smaller loss range. For example, the predicted loss values of 6 s-30\\nand 4 s \\x0027 buildings are 9% smaller and 2.3% larger than the average loss values from detailed models. The\\nhigh accuracy of knowledge-based models is due to the sufficient specificity and volume of available data in\\nthe in- ventory and the high correlation between gross area and loss values [13]. 3.3.2. Data-driven surrogate\\nmodeling In Section 3.2.2 , it was assumed that the designer has no information on building design and can\\nonly provide an educated guess on the range of input variables. In contrast, here, the frames weight (for the\\nreduced model) and beam design information, such as average beam area and reinforcement (for the full-\\nparameter model), are extracted from detailed models and fed into the support vector machines. Fig. 7 compares\\nthe estimated loss from data-driven models to the actual loss values from the detailed analysis. Overall, both\\nfull and reduced models show reasonable accuracy. The predicted loss values of the full model are on average\\n4.5% larger, and 1.8%, 3.5%, and 5.1% smaller than the detailed analysis values for 6 s-30, 5 s-30, 5 s-27,\\nand 4 s \\x0027 buildings, respectively. In comparison, the reduced model pre- dictions are 3.6% larger and 4.1%,\\n3.9%, and 4.5% smaller than the detailed analysis values for the same buildings. Table 4 evaluates whether the\\nsurrogate models could extract the relationship between a design parameter, here, the lateral weight and loss.\\nIn Table 4, a positive sign indicates that the loss values increase for frames with higher lateral weight,\\nwhereas a negative sign represents the opposite trend. The full and reduced data-driven models demonstrate a\\nnegative trend between loss and lateral weight, which follows the detailed analysis only for 6 s-30 and 4 s-27\\nbuildings. This observation is due to the smaller sample size studied here, as the data- driven models are\\ndeveloped based on an extensive frame database and preserve the database trend for design parameters.\\nTherefore, caution should be made not to overly rely on a small set of data-driven surrogate models to deduce\\nearly design insights. 3.3.3. Physics-based surrogate modeling Instead of approximate pushover curves (as\\nshown in Fig. 5a and b), static pushover analysis was performed on all design variations (described in\\nAppendix I) to estimate the base shear (V) - roof displacement (D) curve for equivalent SDOFs. An identical\\napproach as Section 3.2.3 was used to post-process results and derive loss. Fig. 7 shows that SDOF surrogate\\nmodels with complete information agree with detailed analysis. On average, The SDOF models estimate 9.7% and\\n0.2% smaller loss for 6 s-30 and 5 s-27 buildings, and 9.6% and 15.8% larger loss for 5 s-30 and 4 s-27\\nbuildings, respectively. In addi- tion, the data-driven and knowledge-based models provided more ac- curate\\nestimates than the SDOF model when complete design data is available. For example, the SDOFs prediction is, on\\naverage, 11.9% smaller than the full data-driven models. However, it should be noted that the superiority of\\ndata-driven models is due to being trained on identical building class and location. While the results\\nmotivate future statistical models trained for different systems and locations considering the remarkably low\\neffort needed to use these models, nonetheless, SDOF surrogate models can offer a viable option to balance\\naccuracy and effort at seismic early design exploration. Table 3 compares the trend of predicted loss with\\nlateral weight from equivalent SDOF models and detailed analysis. The SDOFs could capture the actual trend for\\nall topologies except for the 6 s-30 building, hence are more accurate in capturing the trend than data-driven\\nmodels. This observation reinforces the advantage of SDOFs in understanding design parameters relationship\\nwith expected performance, particularly in the parametrization of a limited set of design parameters. 4.A\\ngeneral surrogate modeling framework for early design exploration In this section, a sequential surrogate-\\nassisted framework is Fig. 6.Knowledge-based surrogate model using a site- and building spe- cific inventory.\\nFig. 7.Comparison of different surrogate models prediction in presence of complete site- and building-specific\\ninformation. Table 4 Relationship of seismic loss and lateral weight for different design alternatives of\\nstudied concrete buildings.

The framework is applied to the hypothetical building pro- jects under complete and incomplete\\ninformation cases, and the results are compared to estimated losses from individual surrogate models. 4.1.\\nOverview of the sequential framework The inherent and epistemic limitations of different surrogate modeling\\napproaches motivate a framework that leverages each method according to early design stages. Fig. 8 shows the\\nproposed sequential framework and the related early design phases. The underlying concept of the framework is\\nthat each prior surrogate model will (partially or entirely) guide the parametrization of the posterior\\nsurrogate model. The designer is assumed to deal with an initial space with considerable variability between\\n(e.g., choices over structural and flooring systems) and within (e.g., code-minimum or beyond-code member\\nsizing) different subsystems. In early design terminology, the convergence phase refers to reducing the design\\nspace by removing unfavorable al- ternatives. In contrast, the divergence phase refers to expanding the design\\nspace with new candidate alternatives. In the first cycle of convergence, the designer employs knowledge- Fig.\\n8.Proposed framework to complement performance-based early design. Fig. 9.Sequential application of different\\nsurrogate models for (a) 6-story and (b) 4-story buildings. [KBS: knowledge-based, DDS-F: data-driven (full),\\nDDS-R: data- driven (reduced), PBS: physics-based]. M. Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint Engineering Structures\\n286 (2023) 116098 9based models to exclude redundant or unacceptable alternatives. These knowledge-based\\nmodels are derived from prior assessment or expert elicitation, ideally structured as databases for easy\\nqueries. The knowledge-based model must provide data to capture the trend of a given performance measure for\\nthe required input for the data-driven model. The early application of knowledge-based models facilitates\\nassessing a larger number of alternatives at a low expense, and narrows the scope of the subsequent higher-\\nfidelity statistical models. As illus- trated in Section 3, the database should have adequate data specificity\\nand balance. If not possible, it should be used to only distinguish be- tween different systems than\\ntopologies. The resulting reduced space is evaluated through data-driven models at the second convergence\\ncycle. These data-driven models are con- structed by fitting statistical models to a performance inventory\\nthat describes the studied design space. The performance inventory that enables such generalizable and\\naccurate statistical models is obtained by sampling early design parameters, developing building (or\\nsubsystem) models for each sampled parameter set, and performing relevant per- formance assessments such as\\nloss or life cycle assessments. While currently, limited data-driven models exist, the previously narrowed\\nspace enables the user to derive or apply approximate models for a limited set of topologies and systems. This\\nconvergence cycle aims to accurately demarcate performance space and obtain a feasible per- formance range of\\nalternatives. The designer then can employ physics-based models to examine several code-compliant design\\nvariations to further narrow performance space for each selected subsystem. The properties of these models are\\ninformed by the previous data-driven models. Although physics-based surrogate models require additional\\nmodeling efforts, they are compu - tationally inexpensive compared to fully detailed response history\\nanalysis. Therefore, the physics-based model can be a viable solution for the detailed assessment of a limited\\nset of alternatives or to obtain derivative designs through parametric studies as a diverging cycle. An\\nimportant caveat is that while Fig. 8 shows a sequential approach, the transition between different spaces\\ncould be altered depending on available data and models. For example, if data-driven surrogate models are\\ntrained on similar building subsystems, the designer might not implement a physics-based model (which would be\\nexpected to have lower accuracy). In contrast, if data-driven models are unavailable but an abundance of prior\\nassessment exists, the designer might combine knowledge-based and physics-based models to drive the\\nalternative space. The application of the proposed framework to the considered design scenarios will be\\ndiscussed in the next section. For a consistent comparison, the sequential model is applied to estimate the\\nseismic loss of 4- and 6-story buildings. It should be noted that due to limited available data, only data-\\ndriven model output could guide the param - eters of the physics-based models. 4.2. Application to the\\nincomplete information case The sequential framework is applied to the presented case study under the limited\\ninformation. Fig. 9 compares estimated performance ranges from each step (i.e., surrogate model) of the\\nsequence. In a broader context of early design, Fig. 9 provides a visual aid to perform design space\\nexploration, here shown for two topologies of a single lateral-resisting system. The horizontal thick and\\ndashed lines in the zoom plots show the median and two standard deviation loss values for the design\\nvariations estimated from the detailed loss assessment. The results are only presented for 4- and 6-story\\nbuildings. For both 6- and 4- story office projects, the knowledge-based models provide a considerably larger\\nrange than other methods, where the design upper bounds are lower than the minimum values by knowledge- based\\nsurrogate models. If one only uses knowledge-based models, they will considerably (to the order of 10-fold)\\noverestimate loss values. There are two reasons behind this large discrepancy first, the maximum value of the\\nknowledge-based models is directly obtained from structures in California without any modification. As shown\\nby Nikelis et al. [66], the steel frames in Los Angeles could suffer seismic loss values to a magnitude of 5\\nfolds larger than those in Charleston. Second, the loss values are extrapolated for gross usable space values\\noutside the range used in developing regression models, particularly for building A, which has twice the gross\\nusable space as the maximum value in Table 3. As more performance-based assessments are performed on\\nseismically designed structures in the Eastern US, the quality of knowledge-based surrogate models will be\\nimproved to narrow this gap. Meanwhile, the results suggest it is more practical to use knowledge- based\\nsurrogate models for structural system selection (e.g., concrete versus steel frames) than demarcating\\nperformance for a class of buildings unless adequate data exists (such as the case for the west coast). This\\nissue will be further discussed in the next section. In the next stage, the data from published literature was\\nused to constrain the weight input parameter of the data-driven models, whereas building height and floor area\\nwere fixed based on the project information. It should be noted that if the literature provides adequate\\ndesign data, all other parameters of the data-driven models (e.g., average beam section) can be constrained to\\nfurther guide model input. As shown in both Fig. 9, the full-parameter data-driven models provide a\\nsufficiently wide performance range that contains the design variations for both buildings. On the other hand,\\nwhile the reduced model s esti- mates represent median design variations for both buildings, several designs\\nfall outside the estimated range for the 6-story building, as shown in Fig. 9.a. This observation reinforces\\nthe intuition that the applied data-driven model should maintain information on the design variability. If the\\ndesigner develops physics-based models based on the reduced model output (e.g., builds equivalent SDOF\\ncorresponding to the models lateral weight range), they might have false confidence in the estimated\\nperformance. On average, the predicted loss values from full-parameter data-driven models are 10.1% and 10.5%\\nlarger than design variation for 6- and 4-story buildings. The physics-based models are then constructed by\\nconstraining their mass from the data-driven models upper and lower bound values and varying their initial\\nstiffness values. Fig. 9.a and 9.b show that the physics-based models provide a reasonable prediction of loss\\nrange, particularly compared to knowledge-based models. The predicted loss Fig. 10.Comparison of sequential\\nframeworks estimation to prediction from other surrogate models under incomplete information for (a) 6-story\\nand (b) 4- story buildings. M. Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint Engineering Structures 286 (2023) 116098\\n10range for the 4-story building is slightly lower than the actual loss range, whereas the average prediction\\nis 11.9% smaller than the average loss values from detailed models. This observation is intuitive as the\\nrefer- ence building is designed for California, resulting in a lower loss value for a site with lower\\nseismicity. On the other hand, the equivalent SDOF of the 6-story buildings predicts a loss range\\ncorresponding to two standard deviations higher than the median design values, where the average prediction is\\n20.0% higher than the average loss values from detailed models. As shown in Fig. 5.c, the reference building\\nof the 6- story SDOF has a smaller weight and fundamental period, locating the structure at higher spectral\\nvalues of the design spectrum and, conse - quently, larger loss values. This observation emphasizes that\\nbesides site seismicity, the interaction of conducted design and geometry of the reference building impacts\\nthe SDOFs loss prediction, altering the early design inference. In summary, the sequential application of\\ndifferent surrogate models can narrow the performance range and converge to possible loss value in the lack of\\ncomplete information. Fig. 10 compares the results of the proposed framework to the predictions from other\\nsurrogate models under incomplete information. For the 6-story, the difference between the estimated average\\nloss from the proposed sequential framework and knowledge-based, data-driven, and physics-based models are\\n96.3%, 1.6%%, and 9.7%, whereas, for the 4-story building, these differences are 95.9%, 5.2%, 18.9%,\\nrespectively. In both cases, the guidance from prior models led to improved prediction of loss expected value\\nand variation in the sequential framework.

M. Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint\\nEngineering Structures 286 (2023) 116098 114.3. Application to the complete information case Fig. 11 shows the\\nsequential application of surrogate models to es- timate the performance range for the complete information\\ncase. Con- trasting the incomplete case, knowledge-based surrogate models provide a reasonable range that\\ncontains the median design value for both 4- and 6-story buildings. Nevertheless, the knowledge-based model\\ndoes not contain the variability of the 4-story building. This observation suggests that while data\\nspecificity remarkably improves knowledge- based models ability to predict median loss values, data imbalance\\nis critical in accounting for loss variability. Data-driven models contain median loss values from design\\nvaria - tions for all geometries, whereas physics-based models over or under- predict these values for 6 s-30\\nand 5 s-30 buildings. Both surrogate models provide a similar narrow performance range, but none could capture\\nthe loss variability. Compared to the incomplete data case, sequential application of data-driven and physics-\\nbased do not provide notable improvement to narrow performance range. This conclusion is mainly due to the\\nhigh specificity of data-driven models and the lesser accuracy of SDOFs. However, the result cannot be\\ngeneralized for other cases where non-site-specific data-driven models are implemented. Nevertheless, the\\nresults demonstrate the advantage of implementing equivalent SDOFs for parametrizing and expanding performance\\nspace, instead of pinpointing a single system s performance value. Fig. 12 compares the estimated loss from\\nthe sequential framework to the individual surrogate models prediction under complete informa - tion. For the\\n6-story, the difference between the estimated average loss from the proposed sequential framework and\\nknowledge-based, data- driven, and physics-based models are 2.5%, 3.2%%, and 24.4%, whereas, for the 4-story\\nbuilding, these differences are 7.5%, 3.1%, 15.9%, respectively. For both buildings, the sequential\\napplication led to improved estimation of average loss, addressing the bias issues in un- guided physics-based\\nmodels. For the 6-story building, the sequential framework also improved the estimation of the loss\\nvariability. 4.4. Extrapolation beyond the trained parameter range The accuracy of data-driven and knowledge-\\nbased surrogate models depends on the range of sampled parameters within the training data inventory. To\\nillustrate the effect of extrapolation, a new hypothetical 2- story building project was considered, as shown\\nin Fig. 13a. The ge- ometry and design parameters of this building are different from the range of sampled\\nparameters in the building inventory, hence requiring the framework to extrapolate beyond the learned design\\nspace. The simulation framework presented in [13] was used to generate nine de- signs for this building as a\\nreference, similar to Section 3.1.1 . Next, in- dividual surrogate models and sequential framework were used\\nto estimate EAL for the 2-story building. It should be noted that since there are no 2-story building in the\\ncompiled building inventory, the regres - sion model from Section 3.3.1 is used to estimate the average loss\\nvalue from the knowledge-based model. As shown in Fig. 13.c, the data-driven model over predicts the losses\\nfor the 2-story building. The median loss prediction from the data-driven models is 38.1% higher than the\\nobserved values from the detailed assessment. This overprediction is mainly due to the data-driven model being\\ntrained on building with larger footprints that often have higher loss values. In contrast, the physics-based\\nmodel shows a more consis - tent estimation with only a 10.1% difference from the observed values. Fig. 13.b\\nshows that the over-prediction in data-driven models led the subsequent SDOFs into an inaccurate range,\\nresulting in 46.9% bias in the final median loss estimation. To summarize, when extrapolating beyond the\\ntraining data, caution should be given to using data-driven models, and the application of physics-based\\nsurrogate models could provide higher accuracy 5.Conclusion 5.1. Summary This study compared three surrogate\\nmodeling techniques (knowl - edge-based, data-driven, and simplified physics-based models) for seismic design\\nexploration of concrete office buildings for a fixed loca- tion. The surrogate models aimed to predict seismic\\nloss (in terms of repair cost) based on the frames design information for the entire life- cycle of the\\nbuildings. Two levels of available information were considered in developing surrogate models conforming to\\nearly (i.e., incomplete information including only the overall geometry of the building) and late stages\\n(i.e., complete information on geometry and design of frame members) of design. The impact of design data\\navail- ability on surrogate models estimation was investigated. Furthermore, a sequential framework was\\nproposed where the underlying concept is to use lower-fidelity models at earlier stages with the least\\navailable information, and to guide parameters of the higher-fidelity surrogate models at the later stages.\\nThe framework is applied to four concrete frame topology construction in Charleston, South Carolina. The\\nfollowing summarizes the main findings of this study: 1. All surrogate modeling techniques provide reasonable\\naccuracy for the complete design information case. For example, the prediction of median loss from knowledge-\\nbased, data-driven, and physics-based surrogate models was 9.0%%, 4.5%, and 9.7% larger than the detailed\\nanalysis for the 6-story building. 2. For the incomplete design information case, data-driven models are a\\nversatile tool to demarcate the performance space. For example, the prediction of median loss from data-driven\\nmodels was 10.1% and 10.5% larger than the detailed analysis for 6- and 4-story buildings. In contrast, the\\nequivalent SDOFs predictions were 20.0% and 11.9% larger and smaller than the detailed analysis values for the\\nsame buildings. 3.The proposed sequential framework converges to expected perfor - mance from a detailed\\ndesign at low computational cost, and its advantage is more pronounced for the incomplete information case.\\nFor example, the sequential framework resulted in 95.9% and 5.2%, and 18.9% higher accuracy in predicting\\nseismic loss than the knowledge-based, data-driven, and physics-based models under incomplete information for\\nthe 4-story building. 4. Knowledge-based surrogate models should be developed based on site-specific databases\\nwith balanced data for the incomplete infor- mation case. The non-specificity of knowledge-based surrogate\\nmodels could result in shortsighted estimates that woefully mislead the designer. 5.As the size of studies\\ndesign alternatives shrinks, physics-based sur- rogate models become more effective than data-driven models in\\nextracting the relationship between design parameters and seismic loss. 6. The accuracy of studied data-driven\\nmodels largely depends on the training data s sampled input range. In contrast, equivalent SDOFs show higher\\naccuracy than data-driven models for the cases where the designer extrapolates beyond the training data of\\ndata-driven models. 5.2. Limitations and future work Several limitations of the current study are as follows:\\nThe data-driven surrogate models trained on a large performance inventory consistent with the candidate system\\nand site seismicity provide the most accurate result at a very low computational cost; although it is unlikely\\nthat the designer has access to such models. The sensitivity of the framework results to data-driven models\\nderived from other databases should be further explored. M. Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint Engineering\\nStructures 286 (2023) 116098 12 The equivalent SDOF method was selected to represent low-order dynamic models\\ndue to its popularity in estimating the seismic response of buildings. However, there are more refined\\nmethodolo - gies (e.g., using the result of adaptive pushover analysis to derive the backbone curve) that can\\nbe employed. Exploring such techniques could be a valuable future research direction. The results of this\\nstudy are limited to a single class of building and location. Therefore it is critical to investigate more\\ncomprehensive early design scenarios (different building systems and locations). For example, the shortcomings\\nof knowledge-based surrogate models might be less severe for a location with adequate prior research (e.g.,\\nCalifornia). The application of data-driven models in the sequential framework is limited by the input range\\nof the training data. Extrapolation of the framework may lead to erroneous results without significant effort\\nin diversifying the training data. Implementing the sequential framework as an early design tool re- quires\\nconnecting the developed tools and databases to building model information (BIM)-based tools through industry\\nfoundation classes (IFCs). Incorporating performance-based engineering concepts in all design stages, from\\nconceptualization to development, paves the path toward a resilient design [67,68] . A resilient design\\nencompasses different per- formance metrics, such as life-cycle cost and recovery, while accounting for the\\nbuilding s interaction with its surrounding infrastructure. Therefore, the ability to track the effect of\\ndesign decisions on these performance metrics over a single building is a necessary first step to achieving\\ncommunity resilience. Providing access to building models and data is the first step toward facilitating and\\nimproving surrogate modeling-based approaches in early design. Understandably, sharing models is not always\\nfeasible; hence, providing critical data that allows for surrogate model develop - ment is recommended. In the\\ncontext of concrete frames, the authors identified that the following information is critical for knowledge-\\nbased surrogate models: building weight, lateral frames weight, design codes, and requirements, exact location\\nand general topology, raw response history results (EDP-IM pairs), or fitted model, collapse determination\\nmethod and its distribution properties. For equivalent SDOF surrogate models, information on first mode\\nparticipation factor, mass, and ideally static pushover analysis results is critical. Further research is\\nneeded on data-driven models for a class of buildings to identify all data needs. A good practice could be to\\nshare the dataset used to train statistical models as supplementary material. Authors can also provide hyper -\\nparameters of trained models for reproducibility. In the authors opinion, the ultimate goal of performance-\\nbased early design is to have comprehensive performance databases with sufficient granularity to quickly\\nlocate similar designs and perform divergence and Fig. A1.Pushover curve of the design variations.

Appendix I:.Seismic analysis and modeling\\ninformation Hazard information was obtained from the USGS Unified Hazard Tool, and a log log interpolation was\\nimplemented to derive spectral acceleration based on the fundamental period of the dynamic model. A simulation\\npackage was used to generate hazard- consistent GMs through a stochastic method based on probabilistic hazard\\nanalysis of South Carolina with the explicit treatment of wave propagation in the coastal plain [13]. Design\\nvariations were the product of a previously developed framework [13], which auto-generates TCL scripts of two-\\ndimensional nonlinear models for concrete frame buildings based on the user s input topology. These scripts\\nwere then loaded in OpenSees computational framework to assess buildings seismic behavior. The nonlinear model\\nuses elastic members with plastic hinges at both ends for all frame members. The plastic hinge is defined with\\npeak-oriented hysteretic behavior, where the trilinear backbone curve is defined using regression models\\nproposed by Hasleton et al. [69]. In all analytical models, P-delta effects are included using the leaning\\ncolumn concept. Concrete is defined with Concrete01 material with 5 ksi comprehensive strength, whereas steel\\nis defined as Steel01 materials with 240 ksi yield strength. Additionally, pushover analysis using ASCE 7 [59]\\ntriangular load pattern were performed to derive base shear- roof drift relationship for physics-based models.\\nFig. A.1 shows the pushover curves of the design variations for 4- and 6-story topologies. Table A1 provides\\nthe general description for reference building design. Appendix II.Loss assessment methodology An assembly-\\nbased approach [70] is used to relate structural response to seismic loss in terms of direct repair cost\\nassociated with drift-related response (i.e., structural and non-structural drift sensitive assemblies). In\\nthis approach, the total seismic loss (LT) is disintegrated into collapse- related (LC) and non-collapse (LNC)\\nlosses as follows: E LT IM E LNC IM 1\\x00P C IM E LC IM P C IM (1) where IM is earthquake record intensity\\nmeasure, E(X|Y) shows the expected value of random variable X conditioned on random variable Y, and P(X) shows\\nthe probability of random variable X. Collapse-related loss is associated with building experiencing an inter-\\nstory drift over 10% or numerical instability. Non-collapse loss is obtained by summing up losses due to\\nstructural and drift-sensitive structural losses, where each loss is calculated as follows [71]: E\\x00 Lj NCCIM)\\nm i 1 E DV DS i P DS i EDP P EDP IM dEDP (2) where DV, DS, and EDP show decision variables (repair cost),\\ndamage state, and engineering demand parameters. Here, EDP is calculated from dynamic analysis, DS is\\ncalculated by fitting lognormal distribution to EDP-IM pairs, and DV information is obtained from HAZUS\\nguidelines [72].

Technical Committee CEN/TC250 Structural Eurocodes , the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all Structural Eurocodes. This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn at latest by March 2010. This Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. According to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the following countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ircland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swedcn, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Background of the Eurocode programme In 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme 111 the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical speci1~cations. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternativc to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Stcering Committee with Representatives of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement I between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Commission\\'s Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products ~ CPD ~ and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). The Stluctural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts: EN 1990 Eurocode: Basis of structural design EN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures EN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures EN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel stluctures EN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures EN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber stluctures EN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures EN ]997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design EN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance I Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). 5 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) EN ] 999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures Eurocode standards recognize the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these continue to vary from State to State. Status and field of application of Eurocodes The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the fonowing purposes: as a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements of Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N 1 -Mechanical resistance and stability -and Essential Requirement N 2 Safety in case of fire; as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; as a framework for drawing up harmonized technical specifications for construction products (ENs and ETAs) The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from harmonized product standard3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to achieving a full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole structures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covercd and additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases. National Standards implementing Eurocodes The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any annexes), as published by which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex (informative). The National Annex (informative) may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : values for partial factors and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in the Eurocode, values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode~ geographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g. snow map, the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode, references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. Links between Eurocodes and product harmonized technical specifications (ENs (\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to Art. 3 _3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of tile necessary Jinks betwcen the essential requirements and the mandates tor hENs and ETAGsiETAs. According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : a) concrete form to the essential harmonizing the t\"\\' \",,,,,,,I,,,n( and the technical bases and indicating classes where necessary; b) these classes or levels of requirement with the technical e.g. methods of calculation and technical rules for design. etc. ; c) serve as a reference for the establishment standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. The Eurocodes, de playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part ofER 2. 6 and ETAs) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) There is a need for consistency between the harmonized technical specifications for construction products and the technical rulcs for works4. Furthermore, all the information accompanying thc CE Marking of the constIuction products which rcfcr to Eurocodes should clearly mention which Nationally Determined ParaIneters have been taken into account. Additional information specific to EN 1993-1 EN 1993 is intended to be used with Eurocodes EN 1990 -Basis of Structural Design, EN 1991 -Actions on structures and EN 1992 to EN 1999, when steel stluctures or steel components are rcferred to. EN 1993-1 is the first of six parts of EN 1993 Design of Steel Structures. It gives generic design rules intended to be used with the other parts EN 1993-2 to EN 1993-6. It also gives supplementary rules applicable only to buildings. EN 1993-1 comprises twelve subparts EN 1993-1-1 to EN 1993-1-12 each addressing specific stcel components, lilnit states or materials. It may also be used for design cases not covered by the Eurocodes (other structures, other actions, othcr materials) serving as a reference document for other CEN TC\\'s concenling structural matters. EN 1993-1 is intended for use by committees drafting design related product, tcsting and execution standards, clients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements) designers and constructors relevant authorities Numerical values for patiial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of worlananship and quality management applies. 4 See Art.3.3 and Art.l2 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.1. 4.3.

NOTE EN 1090 lists the factors affecting execution that need to be specified during design. (3) Parts sLisceptible to corrosion, mechanical wear or fatigue should be designed such that inspection, maintenance and reconstruction can be carried out satisfactorily and access is available for in-service inspection and maintenance. 28 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (4)8 For building structures no fatigue assessment is normally required except as follows: a) Melnbers supporting lifting appliances or rolling loads b) Members subject to repeated stress cycles from vibrating machinery c) Members subject to wind-induced vibrations d) Members subject to crowd-induced oscillations ~(5)P For elements that cannot be inspected an appropriate corrosion allowance shall be included. @i) (6)B Corrosion protection does not need to be applied to internal building structures, if the internal relative humidity does not exceed 80%). 5 Structural analysis 5.1 Structural modelling for analysis 5.1.1 Structural modelling and basic assumptions ~(l)P Analysis shall be based upon calculation models of the strueture that are appropriate for the limit state under consideration. @i) (2) The calculation model and basic assumptions for the calculations should reflect the structural behaviour at the relevant limit state with appropriate accuracy and reflect the anticipated type of behaviour of the cross sections, members, joints and bearings. ~(3)P The method used for the analysis shall be consistent with the design assumptions. @i) (4)B For the structural modelling and basic assumptions for components of buildings see also EN 1993-1-5 and EN 1993-1-11. 5.1.2 Joint modelling (1) The effects of the behaviour of the joints on the distribution of internal forces and moments within a structure, and on the overall deformations of the structure, may generally be neglected, but where such effects are significant (such as in the case of semi-continuous joints) they should be taken into account, see EN 1993-1-8. (2) To identify whether the effects of joint behaviour on the analysis need be taken into account, a distinction may be made between three joint models as follows, see EN 1993-1-8, 5.1.1 : simple, in which the joint may be assumed not to transll1it bending moments; con6nuous, in which the behaviour of the joint may be assumed to have no effect on the analysis; selni-continuous, in which the behaviour of the joint needs to be taken into account in the analysis (3) The requirements of the various types of joints are given in EN 1993-1-8. 5.1.3 Ground-structure interaction (1) Account should be taken of the deformation characteristics of the supports where significant. NOTE EN 1997 gives guidance for calculation of soil-structure interaction. 29 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) 5.2 Global analysis 5.2.1 Effects of deformed geometry of the structure (I) The internal forces and moments may general1y be determined using either: first-order analysis, using the initial geometry of the structure or second-ordcr analysis, taking into account the influence of the deformation of the structure. (2) The effects of the deformed geometry (second-order effects) should be considered if they increase the action effects significantly or modify significantly the structural behaviour. (3) First order analysis may be used for the structure, if the increase of the relevant internal forces or moments or any other change of structural behaviour caused deformations can be neglected. This condition may be assumed to be fulfilled, if the following criterion is satisfied: Ucr Fer ~ 10 for elastic analysis FEd 2:: 15 for plastic analysis (5.1 ) where Uer is the factor by which the design loading would have to be increased to cause elastic instability in a global mode FEd is the design loading on the structure Fer is the elastic critical buckling load for global instability mode based on initial elastic stiffnesses NOTE A greater limit for Ucr for plastic analysis is given in equation (5.1) because structural behaviour may be significantly influenced by non linear material properties in the ultimate limit state where a frame forms plastic hinges with moment redistributions or where significant non linear deformations from semi-rigid joints occur). Where substantiated by more accurate approaches the National Annex may give a lower limit for Ucr for certain types of frames. (4)B Portal frames with shallow roof slopes and beam-and-column type plane frames in buildings may be checked for sway mode failure with first order analysis if the criterion (5.1) is satisfied for each storey. In thesc structures Uer [ ) should be calculated using the following approximative formula, provided that the axial compression in the beams or rafters is not significant: (5.2) [ ) where is the total design horizontal load, including equivalent forces according to 5.3.2(7), transfelTed by the storey (storey shear) 30 V[d is the total design vertical load on the frame transferred by the storey (storey thrust) @lI b\\'-LEd is the horizontal displacement at the top of the storey, relative to the bottom of the storey, when the frame is loaded with horizontal loads (e.g. wind) and fictitious horizontal loads which arc applied at each floor level h is the storey height h I I I / ~~-~--__ --__ --__ --__ --__ --------~--~~--~r-, I BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) OHEd J I ---1 / I I I / / [ ) Figure 5.1: Notations for 5.2.1 (4) @iI NOTE IS For the application of (4)B in the absence of more detailed information a roof slope may be taken to be shallow if it is not steeper that 1:2 (26 ).

(5) The effects of shear lag and of local buckling on the stiffness should be taken into account if this significantly influences the global analysis, see EN 1993-1-5. NOTE For rolled sections and welded sections with similar dimensions shear lag effects may be neglected. (6) The effects on the global analysis of the slip in bolt holes and similar deformations of connection devices like studs and anchor bolts on action effects should be taken into account, where relevant and significant. 5.2.2 Structural stability of frames (1) If according to 5.2.1 the influence of the deformation of the structure has to be taken into account (2) to (6) should be applied to consider these effects and to verify the structural stability. (2) The verification of the stability of frames or their parts should be carried out considering imperfections and second order effects. (3) According to the type of frame and the global analysis, second order effects and imperfections may be accounted for by one of the following methods: a) both totally by the global analysis, b) partially by the global analysis and partially through individual stability checks of members according to 6.3, c) for basic cases by individual stability checks of equivalent members according to 6.3 using appropriate buckling lengths according to the global buckling mode of the structure. 31 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (4) Second order effccts may be calculated by using an analysis appropriate to the structure (including step-by-step or other itcrative procedures). For frames where the first sway buckling mode is prcdominant first order elastic analysis should be carried out with subsequent amplification of relevant action effects (e.g. bending moments) by appropriate factors. (5)8 For single storey frames designed on the basis of clastic global analysis second order sway effects due to vertical loads may be calculated by increasing the horizontal loads (e.g. wind) and equivalent loads <p due to imperfections (sec 5.3.2(7)) and other possible sway effects according to first order theory by the factor: (5.4 ) U(;r provided that au 3,0, where an may be calculated according to (5.2) in 5.2.1(4)B, provided that the roof slope is shallow and that the axial compression in the beams or rafters is not significant as defined in 5.2.1 (4)B. NOTE B For (Xcr 3,0 a morc accurate second order analysis applies. (6)B For multi-storey frames second order sway cfTects may be calculated by means of the method given in (5)8 provided that all storeys have a similar distribution of vertical loads and distribution of horizontal loads and distribution of frame stiffness with respect to the applied storey shear forces. NOTE B For the limitation of the method see also 5.2.1(4)B. (7) In accordance with (3) the stability of individual members should be checked according to the fo11owing: a) If second order effects in individual members and relevant member imperfections (see 5.3.4) are totally accounted for in the global analysis of the structure, no individual stability check for the members according to 6.3 is necessary. b) If second order effects in individual members or certain individual member imperfections (c.g. member imperfections for flexural and/or lateral torsional buckling, see 5.3.4) are not totally accounted for in the global analysis~ the individual stability of members should be checked according to the relevant criteria in 6.3 for the effects not included in the global analysis. This verification should take account of end moments and forces from the global analysis of the structure, including global second order effects and global imperfections (see 5.3.2) when relevant and may be based on a buckling length equal to the system length (8) Where the stability of a frame is assessed by a check with the equivalent column method according to 6.3 the buckling length values should be based on a global buckling mode of the frame accounting for the stiffness behaviour of members and joints, the presence of plastic hinges and the distribution of compressive forces under the design loads . .In this case intenlal forces to be used in resistance checks are calculated according to first order theory without considering imperfections. NOTE The National Annex may give information on the scope of application. 5.3 Imperfections 5.3.1 Basis (1) Appropriate allowances should be incorporated in the structural analysis to cover the effects of imperfections, including residual stresses and geometrical imperfections such as lack of verticality, lack of 32 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) straightness, lack of flatness, lack of fit eccentricities greater than the essential to1cranccs give in EN 1090-2 present in joints of the unloaded structure. (2) Equivalent geometric imperfections, see 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, should be used, with values which rcflect thc possible effects of all type of imperfections unless these effects are included in the resistance formulae for member design, see section 5.3.4. (3) The following imperfections should be taken into account: a) global imperfections for frames and bracing systcms b) local imperfections for individual members 5.3.2 Imperfections for global analysis of frames (1) The assumed shape of global imperfections and local impcrfections may bc dcrived from the clastic buckling mode of a structure in the plane of buckling considered. (2) Both in and out of plane buckling including torsional buckling with symmetric and asymmetric buckling shapes should be taken into account in the most unfavourable direction and form. (3) For frames sensitive to buckling in a sway mode the effect of imperfections should be allowed for in frame analysis by means of an equivalent imperfection in the form of an initial sway imperfection and individual bow imperfections of members. The imperfections may be determined from: a) global initial sway imperfections, see Figure 5.2: (5.5) where q)o is the basic value: <Po = 1/200 ah is the reduction factor for height h applicable to columns: h is the height of the structure in metcrs am is the reduction factor for the number of columns in a row: am = m is the number of columns in a row including only those columns which carry a vertical load not less than 500/0 of the average value of the column in the vertical plane considcred h Figure 5.2: Equivalent sway imperfections b) relative initial local bow imperfections of members for flexural buckling eo / L where L is the member length h (5.6) NOTE The values Co / L may be chosen in the National Annex.

(10) The possible torsional effects on a structure caused by anti-symmetric sways at the two opposite faces, should also be considered, see Figure 5.5.

(2) For convenience, the effects of the initial bow in1perfections of the members to be restrained by a bracing system, may be replaced by the equivalent stabilizing force as shown in Figure 5.6: 36 eo + c5 8 __ 1} L2 (5.13) BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) where <Sq is the inplane deflection of the bracing system due to q plus any external loads calculated from first order analysis NOTE Sq may be taken as 0 if second order theory is used. (3) Where the bracing system is required to stabilize the compression flange of a beam of constant height, the force NEd in Figure 5.6 may be obtained from: NEd = MEd / h (5.14) where MEd is the maximum moment in the beam and h is the overall depth of the beam. NOTE Where a beam is subjected to external compreSSIOn NEd should include a part of the compression force. (4) At points where beams or compression members are spliced, it should also be verified that the bracing system is able to resist a local force equal to amNEd / 100 applied to it by each beam or compression member which is spliced at that point, and to transmit this force to the adjacent points at which that beam or con1pression member is restrained, see Figure 5.7.

In gcneral an additional torsional inlpcrfection need not to be allowed for. NOTE The National Annex may choose the value ofk. The value k 0,5 is recommended. 5.4 Methods of analysis considering material non-linearities 5.4.1 General (1) Thc intcrnal forces and l1101nents may bc determined using eithcr a) elastic global analysis b) plastic global analysis. NOTE For finite element model (FEM) analysis sec EN 1993-1-5. (2) Elastic global analysis may be used in all cases. 38 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (3) Plastic global analysis may be used only where thc structure has sufficient rotation capacity at thc actual locations of the plastic hinges, whether this is in the membcrs or in thc joints. Wherc a plastic hingc occurs in a ll1cmber, thc mcmber cross sections should be double symnlctric or single symmetric with a plane of symmetry in the sanle plane as the rotation of the plastic hinge and it should satisfy thc rcquirements specified in 5.6. Where a plastic hinge occurs in a joint the joint should either have sufficient strength to ensure the hinge remains in the member or should be able to sustain the plastic resistance for a sufficient rotatio11, see EN 1993-1-8. (4)B As a simplified method for a limited plastic redistribution of moments in continuous beams where following an elastic analysis some peak moments exceed the plastic bending resistance of 15 % maximum, the parts in excess of these peak moments may bc redistributed in any membcr, provided, that: a) the internal forces and moments in the framc remain in equilibrium with the applicd loads, and b) all the members in which the moments are reduced have Class 1 or Class 2 cross-sections (sce 5.5), and c) lateral torsional buckling of the members is prevented. 5.4.2 Elastic global analysis (1) Elastic global analysis should be based on the assumption that the stress-strain bchaviour of thc material is linear, whatever the stress level is. NOTE For the choice of a semi-continuous joint model see 5.1.2 (2) Intemal forces and moments may be calculated according to elastic global analysis cvcn if thc resistance of a cross section is based on its plastic resistance, scc 6.2. (3) Elastic global analysis may also be used for cross sections the resistances of which are limited by local buckling, see 6.2. 5.4.3 Plastic global analysis (l) Plastic global analysis allows for the effects of material non-linearity in calculating thc action cffects of a stnlctural system. Thc bchaviour should be modcllcd by one of the following mcthods: by elastic-plastic analysis with plastified scctions and/or joints as plastic hingcs, by non-linear plastic analysis considering the partial plastificatio11 of membcrs in plastic lones, by rigid plastic analysis neglecting thc elastic behaviour betwecn hingcs. (2) Plastic global analysis may be used where the members are capable of sufficicnt rotation capacity to enable the required redistributions ofbcnding Inomcnts to develop, see 5.5 and 5.6. (3) Plastic global analysis should only be used where the stability of members at plastic hinges can be assured, see 6.3.5. (4) The bi-linear stress-strain relationship indicated in Figure 5.8 may be used for thc grades of structural steel specified in section 3. Altenlatively, a more precise relationship may be adoptcd, see EN 1993-1-5. (J\" Figure 5.8: Bi-linear stress-strain relationship 39 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (5) Rigid plastic analysis may be applied if no effects of the deformed geomehy (e.g. second-order effects) have to be considered. Tn this case joints are classified only by strength, see EN 1993-1-8. (6) The effects of deformed geometry of the structure and the structural stability of the frame should be verified according to the principles in 5.2. NOTE The maximum resistance of a frame with significantly deformed geomehy may occur before all hinges of the first order collapse mechanism have fonned. 5.5 Classification of cross sections 5.5.1 Basis (1) The role of cross section classification is to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation capacity of cross sections is limited by its local buckling resistance. 5.5.2 Classification (1) Four classes of cross-sections are defined, as follows: Class 1 cross-sections are those which can form a plastic hinge with the rotation capacity required from plastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. Class 2 cross-sections arc those which can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited rotation capacity because of local buckling. Class 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the extreme compression fibre of the steel member assuming an elastic distribution of stresses can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to prevent deve lopment of the plastic moment resistance. Class 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will occur before the attainment of yield stress in one or more parts of the cross-section. (2) ]n Class 4 cross sections effective widths may be used to make the necessary allowances for reductions in resistance due to the effects of local buckling, see [ ) EN 1993-1-5, 4.4 J. (3) The classification of a cross-section depends on the width to thickness ratio of the parts subject to compreSSiOn. (4) Compression parts include every part of a cross-section which IS either totally or partially 111 compression under the load combination considered. (5) The various compression parts in a cross-section (such as a web or t1ange) can, in general, be in different classes. (6) A cross-section is classified according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression parts. Exceptions are specified in 6.2.1 (10) and 6.2.2.4(1). (7) Alternatively the classification of a cross-section may be defined by quoting both the flange classification and the web classification. (8) The limiting proportions for Class 1, 2, and 3 compression parts should be obtained from Table 5.2. A part which fails to satisfy the limits for Class 3 should be taken as Class 4. (9) Except as given in (10) Class 4 sections may be treated as Class 3 sections if the width to thickness ratios are less than the limiting proportions for Class 3 obtained from Table 5.2 when is increased by fy / Y MO 1 . 1 . d\\' . . 1 k f fi d --- , W1ere (J com.Ed IS t 1e maX1111Um eSlgn compreSSIVe stress 111 t 1e part ta en rom 1rst or er or (J cOIll.Ed where necessary second order analysis. 40 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (10) However, when verifying the design buckling resistance of a member using section 6.3, the limiting proportions for Class 3 should always be obtained from Table 5.2. (11) Cross-sections with a Class 3 wcb and Class I or 2 flanges may bc classified as class 2 cross sections with an eHective web in accordance with 6.2.2.4. (12) Where the web is considered to resist shear forces only and is assumed not to contribute to the bending and normal force resistance of the cross section, the cross section may be designed as Class 2, 3 or 4 sections, depending only on the flange class. NOTE For flange induced web buckling see EN 1993-1-5. 5.6 Cross-section requirements for plastic global analysis (1) At plastic hinge locations, the cross-section of the member which contains the plastic hinge should have a rotation capacity of not less than the required at the plastic hinge location. (2) In a uniform member sufficient rotation capacity may be assumed at a plastic hinge if both the following requirements arc satisfied: a) the member has Class 1 cross-sections at the plastic hinge location; b) where a transverse force that exceeds 10 % of the shear resistance of the cross section, see 6.2.6, is applied to the web at the plastic hinge location, web stiffeners should be provided within a distance along the Inelnber of h/2 from the plastic hinge location, lEV where h is the height of the cross section @II. (3) Where the cross-section of the mcmber vary along length @II, the following additional criteria should be satisfied: a) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the thickness of the web should not be reduced for a distance each way along the member from the plastic hinge location of at least 2d, where d is the clear depth of the web at the plastic hinge location. b) Adjacent to plastic hinge locations, the compression flange should be Class I for a distance each way along the member from the plastic hinge location of not less than the of: 2d, where d is as defined in (3)a) the distance to the adjacent point at which the moment in the member has fallen to 0,8 times the plastic moment resistance at the point conce111cd. e) Elsewhere in the member the compression flange should be class I or class 2 and the web should be class 1, class 2 or class 3.

The following numerical values are recommended for buildings: YMO 1,00 YMI = ] ,00 YM2 = 1,25 6.2 Resistance of cross-sections 6.2.1 General 1Ei>(1)P The design value of an action effect in each eross section shall not exceed the corresponding design resistance and if several action effects act simultaneously the combined effect shaH not exeeed the resistance for that combination. @il (2) Shear lag effects and local buekling effects should be included by an effective width according to EN 1993-1-5. Shear buckling effects should also be considered according to EN 1993-1-5. (3) The design values of resistance should depend on the classification of the cross-section. (4) Elastic verification according to the elastic resistance may be carried out for all cross sectional classes provided the effective cross sectional properties are used for the verification of class 4 cross sections. (5) For the elastic verification the following yield criterion for a critical point of the eross section may be used unless other interaction f01111ulae apply, see 6.2.8 to 6.2.10.

Therefore it should only be performed where the interaction of on the basis of resistances NRd , MRd , V Rd cannot be performed. 45 BS EN 1993-1-1:2005 EN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) (6) The plastic resistance of cross sections should be verified by finding a stress distribution which is in equilibrium with the internal forces and moments without exceeding the yield strength. This stress distribution should be compatible with the associated plastic deformations. (7) As a conservative approximation for all cross section classes a lincar summation of the utilization ratios for cach strcss resultant may be used. For class 1, class 2 or class 3 cross sections subjected to the combination of , M\\\\.[d and Mz,Ed this method may be applicd by using the following criteria: Mz.Ed +-- M z.Rd (6.2) where NRd , My,Rd and Mz.Rd are the design values of the resistance depending on the cross sectional classification and including any rcduction that Illay be caused by shear effects, see 6.2.8. NOTE For class 4 cross sections sec 6.2.9.3(2). (8) Wherc all the compression parts of a cross-section are ~ Class 1 or Class 2 @l], the cross-section may be taken as capable of dcveloping its full plastic resistance in bending. (9) Where all the compression parts of a cross-section are Class 3, its resistance should be based on an clastic distribution of strains across the cross-section. Compressive stresses should be limited to the yield strength at the extreme fibres. NOTE The extreme fibres may be assumed at the midplane of the t1anges for ULS checks. For fatigue see EN 1993-1-9. (10) Where yiclding first occurs on the tension side of the cross section, the plastic reserves of the tension zone may be utilized by accounting for partial plastification when determining the resistance of a Class 3 cross-section. 6.2.2 Section properties 6.2.2. t Cross cross-section (1) The properties of the gross cross-section should be determined using the nominal dimensions. Holes for fasteners need not be deducted, but allowance should be made for larger openings. Splice materials should not be included. 6.2.2.2 Net area (1) The net area of a cross-sect jon should be taken as its gross area less appropriate deductions for all holes and other openings.

For countersunk holes, appropriate allowance should be made for the countersunk portion. (3) Provided that the fastener holes are not staggered, the total area to be deducted for fastener holes should be the maximum sum of the sectional areas of the holes in any cross-section perpendicular to the member axis (see failure plane (?) in Figure 6.1).

This paper evaluates the relative capabilities of three surrogate modeling \\napproaches to estimate seismic loss under complete and incomplete design information scenarios. Three surro-\\ngate models of knowledge-based (i.e., from prior published assessments), data-driven (i.e., support vector ma-\\nchine  trained  on  a  simulation-based  building  inventory),  and  physics-based  (i.e.,  equivalent  single-degree-of- \\nfreedom systems) are systematically used to estimate bounds on direct seismic loss for four hypothetical con-\\ncrete  office  construction  projects  in  Charleston,  South  Carolina.  Subsequently,  a  framework  is  presented  that \\nimplements  these  surrogate  models  as  a  sequence  to  explore  design  alternatives  consistent  with  divergence- \\nconvergence  cycles  of  early  design  exploration.  The  results  show  that  all  different  surrogate  models  provide \\nreasonable  accuracy  for  the  complete  design  information  case,  whereas  data-driven  models  provided  higher \\naccuracy  than  the  other  models.  For  incomplete  design  information,  the  data-driven  models  demarcated  the \\nperformance space and estimated the same median loss values as detailed loss analysis. In contrast, physics-based \\nsurrogate  models  were  more  accurate  in  capturing  the  relationship  between  loss  and  design  parameters  for \\nsmaller sets of design alternatives. Nevertheless, all different surrogate modeling techniques were inadequate to \\ncapture loss variability between different designs of the same geometry.   \\n\\n1. Introduction \\n\\nEarly  design  is  the  process  of  formulating  a  design  problem,  col-\\nlecting  and  contextualizing  data,  and  progressively  addressing  the \\nidentified  issues.  For  modern  construction,  early  design  becomes  an \\ninterdisciplinary multi-faceted problem [1] that integrates conventional \\narchitectural  thinking  with  various  objectives  such  as  environmental \\nperformance [2,3], energy efficiency [4], structural safety and integrity, \\nand long-term performance [5]. The recent interest in improving resil-\\niency calls for early design frameworks that ensure the selected mate-\\nrials,  subsystems,  and  topologies  will  lead  to  high-performing  design \\nwith respect to natural hazard impact [6–8]. \\n\\nA  performance-based  early  design  framework  (PBED)  [9]  aims  to \\nimprove  early  design  by  integrating  the  hazard-related  expertise  of \\nstructural  engineers  into  an  architect-led  design  process.  PBED  quan-\\ntifies  different  design  alternatives’  life-cycle  structural  performance \\nacross  multiple  performance  domains,  such  as  natural  hazards  and \\nenvironmental  impacts.  Estimating  structural  response  to  natural \\n\\nhazards is the most time- and computational-intensive step in PBED, as \\nsophisticated  analytical  models  must  describe  the  system’s  entire  life \\ncycle. For example, to evaluate structures life-cycle performance under \\nearthquakes, these analytical models should be subjected to a ground \\nmotion  suite  representing  different  ground  shaking  intensities  to  ac-\\ncount for the record-to-record variability [10–12]. \\n\\nInsufficient and imprecise information on building footprint, topol-\\nogy, and material type renders performing performance-based seismic \\nassessments cumbersome, if not infeasible, in early design. Therefore, \\nPBED  uses  surrogate  models  that  can  be  evaluated  faster  than  the \\ndetailed analytical model with reasonable accuracy [13]. The applica-\\ntion of surrogate models in early seismic design poses questions on their \\nsuitability for generating insights in the presence of limited information. \\nHowever, the literature on the feasibility of surrogate models is domi-\\nnated  by  detailed  design  [14,15].  A  review  of  different  surrogate \\nmodeling approaches for seismic design and assessments is presented in \\nSection 2. \\n\\nTwo  crucial  issues  remain  if  an  argument  can  be  made  on  the \\n\\n* Corresponding author. \\n\\nE-mail address: mohsen.zaker@usu.edu (M.

First, various surrogate \\nmodeling techniques are available, and their advantages and limitations \\nwith  respect  to  performance  estimation  under  different  design  infor-\\nmation  levels  are  not  well-understood.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  to \\ninvestigate how different surrogate models balance computational ease, \\nthe designer’s effort and time, and estimation accuracy at early design. \\nSecond, a framework is needed to overcome the inherent limitations of \\nvarious  models,  and  maximize  surrogate  models’  usefulness  by  sys-\\ntematically integrating each surrogate type in the alternating cycles of \\nearly design. \\n\\nThis paper compares the relative capabilities of different surrogate \\nmodeling  techniques  to  directly  estimate seismic  loss  under complete \\nand incomplete design information. Here, the incomplete scenario refers \\nto only the availability of the building’s overall geometry (e.g., height, \\nfootprint) and selected lateral-resisting systems, whereas the complete \\nscenario  indicates  the  availability  of  all  relevant  design  information, \\nsuch as member sizing. The results of the comparative study are then \\nused to propose a systematic approach that implements the discussed \\nsurrogate  models  sequentially  in  performance-based  early  design \\nexploration. In  the proposed  sequential framework,  the lower  fidelity \\nmodels are assigned to initial steps to deal with a large design space, and \\nas  the  design  evolves,  surrogate  models  with  higher  computational \\nneeds are employed to assess reduced design space. Each prior model \\nconstrains the input space for the posterior model to reduce the overall \\ncomputational cost and guide the exploration of design space. To illus-\\ntrate the framework’s application, knowledge-based, data-driven, and \\nphysics-based surrogate models are developed for a case study of mid- \\nrise concrete frame projects with fixed footprints and location. The or-\\nganization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature for \\neach class of surrogate modeling techniques used in this study. Section 3 \\ndescribes  the  illustrative  example  and  develops  individual  surrogate \\nmodels  for  complete  and  incomplete  design  information  scenarios. \\nSection  4  describes  the  sequential  framework  and  demonstrates  its \\napplication  for  the  case  study.  Lastly,  the  results  of  the  sequential \\nframework are compared to the individual surrogate models predictions. \\n\\n2. Literature review \\n\\n2.1.

Here, “knowledge-based” is loosely \\nused to refer to all methods of extracting human expert knowledge and \\nencoding  them  in  an  algorithm  or  digital  product,  such  as  literature- \\nbased discovery [16], ontology-based information extraction [17], and \\nnatural  language  processing  [18].  The  majority  of  limited  efforts  are \\naimed at developing databases for regional vulnerability models [19], \\nsuch  as  GEM  [20]  and  HAZUS  [21].  As  structured  open  databases \\nemerge,  developing  knowledge-based  surrogate  models  becomes \\nincreasingly accessible. \\n\\nOmoya et  al.  developed a  relational database  that provides actual \\nbuilding  damage  and  recovery  data  from  the  2014  Napa  Earthquake \\n[22]. Guan et al. developed a database of seismic design and nonlinear \\nmodels of 621 special steel moment frames generated by an automated \\ncomputational  framework.  Additionally,  they  provided  time  history \\nassessments for a subset of 100 frames subjected to 140 ground motion \\nrecords for future data mining applications. However, the dataset is not \\nstructured for easy querying [23]. Recently, Esteghamati et al. devel-\\noped a relational database of existing literature on performance-based \\nseismic assessment of buildings. This database contains information on \\n222 mid-rise building seismic assessments from the US, Europe, and Asia \\n[24]. Additional tools for querying the database are also provided in a \\npublic repository [25]. Nevertheless, the database does not provide loss \\nassessment values and supports a limited number of building topologies \\nand site locations. \\n\\n2.2. Data-driven surrogate models \\n\\nThe literature on data-driven surrogate models is focused on map-\\nping high-level feature space to structural response [26–29]. Here data- \\ndriven refers to all statistical learning methods (e.g., regression, artificial \\nneural  networks)  employed  to  predict  the  seismic  response  based  on \\nstructural  system  properties  without  performing  dynamic  analysis. \\nAmong the limited literature on building seismic performance, efforts \\nhave  been  made  for  concrete  frames  [30–32],  steel  frames  [33,34], \\ninfilled concrete frames [35], and rocking braced frames [36,37]. These \\nstudies  use  detailed  structural  parameters  (e.g.,  ductility  parameters, \\nmembers’  strength)  and  ground  motion  characteristics  (e.g.,  intensity \\nmeasures,  direction)  to  predict  structural  peak  responses  or  fragility \\nfunctions for limited case study buildings. A complete review of studies \\naimed  at  predicting  structural  response  using  data-driven  surrogate \\nmodels can be found in Sun et al. [38]. \\n\\nMoving toward generalizable surrogate models, a notable work by \\nGuan et al. developed ensemble-based and hybrid statistical methods to \\nestimate  drift  demands  of  steel  moment  frames  [39].  Among  the  few \\nworks explicitly aimed at early design, Esteghamati and Flint developed \\na simulation-based inventory to train generalizable surrogate models for \\nmid-rise concrete frame office buildings using crude topology and design \\nparameters.  They  concluded  that  support  vector  machines  could \\nreasonably estimate total loss using only estimable parameters such as \\nfloor area, height, and frame weight for a fixed location [13]. \\n\\n2.3. Physics-based surrogate models \\n\\nA  large  body  of  research  proposed  different  physics-based  (i.e., \\nmechanistic or phenomenological) surrogate models, such as shear and \\nflexural  beam  theory  [40],  and  equivalent  single-degree-of-freedom \\n(SDOF) systems [41]. Historically, SDOF systems are assumed to be a \\nreasonably accurate approximation for building systems dominated by a \\nsingle mode. One of the earliest studies by Gupta and Krawinkler laid the \\nfoundation  for  estimating  inter-story  drift  of  frame  structures  from \\nequivalent  SDOFs’  displacement.  Although  the  SDOF  accuracy  varied \\nbased on the number of stories and ground motion characteristics, it was \\ndeemed a valuable tool for early design [42]. \\n\\nVamvatsikos  and  Cornell  introduced  the  SPO2IDA  methodology, \\nwhich  uses  the  equivalent  SDOF  concept  to  relate  static  pushover  of \\nbuildings to traces of incremental dynamic analysis [43,44].

Recently, Vaseghiamiri et al. developed Bayesian \\nregression  models  to  derive  SDOF  backbone  parameters  for  steel \\nmultistory  frames  considering  modeling  uncertainties.  They  showed \\nthat the developed SDOFs could accurately capture roof drift ratios, even \\nfor frames with different designs used to derive regression models [47]. \\nAs  these  physics-based  surrogate  models  are  applied  to  case  study \\nbuildings to derive performance, one might consider structuring their \\nresults  as  a  knowledge-based  repository  for  future  early  design \\napplications. \\n\\n3. The depth of literature on different surrogate varies. Therefore, sig-\\nnificant hurdles exist in implementing each method in a real-world \\nproject.  A  systematic  approach  is  needed  to  utilize  and  comple-\\nment different modeling techniques to explore early design space. \\n\\nTo address these shortcomings, this study has three main objectives: \\n(a) evaluate the accuracy of various surrogate modeling techniques to \\nestimate hazard performance measures, (b) assess the effect of design \\ninformation availability on the accuracy of these models, (c) propose a \\nsystematic approach to integrate these surrogate models for a low-cost \\nand accurate performance-based design space exploration. \\n\\n3.

As shown in Table 1, significant advantages and disadvantages exist \\nfor each surrogate modeling type, and the tradeoff between different \\nmodels’ accuracy, required information, and ease of implementation \\nhas not been thoroughly investigated. \\n\\nThis section first describes an early design scenario.

Early design scenario \\n\\nA structural engineer is consulted to estimate the life-cycle seismic \\nperformance of a concrete frame as a candidate lateral-resisting system \\nfor four office building projects. As shown in Fig. 2, office A is a 6-story \\nbuilding with six 30- feet (9.14 m) bays in both directions, office B is a 5- \\nstory building with three and five 30-feet bays in each direction, office C \\nis another 5-story building with four and five 27-feet (8.2 m) bays in \\neach direction, and lastly, office D is a 4-story concrete frame with five \\n27-feet bays (8.2 m) in both directions. As shown in Fig. 2, all building \\nprojects are assumed to be located on an identical site in Charleston, \\nSouth Carolina, USA (32.722105, (cid:0) 79.93408), where they are subjected \\nto high seismicity hazard (SDS = 0.75 g and SD1 = 0.38 g for site class B/ \\nC  boundary).

Surrogate models development using incomplete data \\n\\nIn  this  section,  the  three  types  of  surrogate  models  are  developed \\nusing  only  crude  geometric  information  for  the  described  concrete \\nbuildings in Section 3.1. These surrogate models use buildings’ height \\nand footprint from the project description and supplement the remain-\\ning information from published literature as discussed in the following. \\n\\n3.2.1. Knowledge-based surrogate modeling \\n\\nA literature review, including a query on the INSSEPT database [25], \\nwas performed to identify mid-rise concrete moment frames with similar \\ngeometry as the studied buildings. Table 3 reports the value extracted \\nfrom the papers and the INSSEPT database. Due to the shortage of full \\nperformance-based assessments, the available literature often does not \\nprovide results from buildings with similar geometry (e.g., floor area, \\nheight)  and  design  processes  (e.g.,  building  codes,  different  seismic \\nhazard levels). Furthermore, the lack of adequate PBEE assessments for \\nCharleston exacerbates the issue, as the available buildings for sites with \\nsimilar  seismicity  (i.e.,  Eastern  US)  are  not  designed  to  withstand \\nSeismic  loads.  These  differences  result  in  a  considerably  different \\nperformance. \\n\\nSeveral remedies are used to alleviate the non-specificity of assess-\\nment results. Efforts are made only to select concrete frame buildings \\nwith similar geometry (e.g., mid-rise, regular frames). Also, whenever \\nseismic demand and collapse data were available, fragility curves were \\nderived  based  on  the  HAZUS  guideline  [61]  for  structural  and  non- \\nstructural components, following the approach discussed in Appendix \\nII. These fragility curves were then integrated with Charleston hazard \\ndata to calculate the expected annual loss. If the demand model data was \\nunavailable, the reported normalized values (in terms of percentage of \\nbuilding cost) were directly used. All normalized expected loss values \\nwere  multiplied  by  the  RC  construction  cost  in  Charleston  to  derive \\nmonetary values. \\n\\nFig.  3  shows  the  derived  expected  annual  loss  and  corresponding \\nregression-based surrogate models. Data is grouped into three different \\ngroups  based  on  the  site’s  seismicity  and  post-processing  levels:  sites \\nwith  similar  seismicity  (the  Central  Eastern  US)  modified  based  on \\nCharleston  hazard  data,  sites  with  higher  seismicity  which  their  loss \\nvalues are not modified, and lastly, unaltered loss values from sites with \\nlower seismicity. As shown in Fig. 3, the studied archetype buildings are \\nexpected to fall into the shaded area. It should be noted that concrete \\nbuildings located in a site with different seismicity are proportioned to \\nresist a different lateral load level and provide disparate ductility and \\nstrength.  Furthermore,  the  expected  loss  (even  when  modified)  is \\nderived from subjecting the original structure to ground motion records \\nsuitable  for  the  corresponding  study’s  site.  Therefore,  the  results  are \\nonly  treated  as  upper  and  lower  bounds  on  estimated  performance \\n\\nFig.  3.

These design variations also \\nprovide data to derive data-driven (e.g., weight) and physics-based (e.g., \\nbase shear-roof drift relationship and mass factor) surrogate models for \\nthe complete data case. \\n\\nThe 32 design variations were obtained by assigning different rein-\\nforced  concrete  section  sizes  to  frame  members  that  meet  the  code’s \\nminimum and maximum longitudinal and transverse reinforcement re-\\nquirements. Finite element models of these frames were then developed \\nin OpenSees [58] and subjected to 20 site-specific ground motions scaled \\nto the site’s Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) level, as described \\nin Appendix I. The structural responses were checked against the ASCE 7 \\ncode’s [59] requirements on collapse (no more than two collapse cases) \\nand maximum drift values (less than 4% interstory drift values). Addi-\\ntional  information  on  design  alternatives  modeling  can  be  found  in \\nAppendix I. It should be noted that the design variations represent hy-\\npothetical buildings that meet the global life safety objective, instead of \\na  careful  design  that  precisely  meet  all  different  requirements  (e.g., \\nconstructability, wind design, panel zone shear checks). Lastly, seismic \\nloss values are derived for each design variation following the approach \\nbriefly described in Appendix I. Seismic loss is quantified using expected \\nannual loss (EAL) in terms of repair cost after an earthquake during the \\nbuilding service life of 50 years. EAL accounts for all the possible seismic \\nhazard levels at the site, and hence, emphasizes the losses due to more \\nfrequent events [60]. Additional information on reference alternatives \\nand loss methodology can be found in [13]. \\n\\nFig. 4.

Data-driven surrogate modeling \\n\\nA  previously  developed  support  vector  machine  regression  (SVR) \\nmodel [13] is used to derive seismic loss for the considered buildings. \\nThe SVR model is specifically developed to be applicable in early design, \\nwhere (i) only a few crude input parameters are required that are either \\navailable or estimable by the user, and (ii) loss is directly predicted, so \\nno  intermediate  calculations  are  needed.  Furthermore,  the  SVR  is \\ntrained on a vulnerability inventory comprising concrete frames located \\nin Charleston. Thus there is an excellent agreement between data uti-\\nlized in SVR development and the current project’s taxonomy. The ac-\\ncuracy of SVR models was assessed based on root-mean squared error \\n(RMSE) of testing set. RMSE measures the second sample moment of the \\ndeviation  between  predicted  and  observed  values  (i.e.,  residuals), \\nproviding  an efficient  means  to  assess  the  performance of  regression- \\nbased models. \\n\\nTwo variations of the developed SVR were implemented: (1) a full \\nmodel  which  uses  building  height,  transverse  dimension,  floor  area, \\nlateral-resisting frame weight, average beam area, average beam area at \\nthe first floor, and average beam reinforcement ratio, and (2) a reduced \\nmodel which uses building height, building dimension in the transverse \\ndirection, floor area and weight of lateral frames at the expense of lower \\naccuracy. For the studied buildings, height and floor area are known, \\nand the user needs to roughly estimate four and one other parameters for \\nthe  full  and  reduced  models,  respectively.  It  is  expected  that  a  user \\nwithout extensive prior experience can provide an array of input vari-\\nables to approximately demarcate the performance space. \\n\\nFig. 4 shows the predicted seismic loss using full and reduced SVR \\nmodels for the building topologies. Here, the  user demarcates perfor-\\nmance space based on the assumed minimum and maximum values for \\neach  of  the  seven  input  parameters.  In  addition,  a  random  sample  of \\n1000  additional  designs  with  the  same  geometry  but  different  beam \\ndesigns  and  lateral  weight  values  are  generated  to  cover  the  perfor-\\nmance space. The estimated loss from the reduced model is shown as \\noverlaid thick lines in Fig. 4. \\n\\nThe full data-driven models in Fig. 4 suggest that the 6-story building \\n(i.e., 6 s-30) has the highest loss regardless of its design. In addition, the \\nestimated loss for the 5-story buildings (i.e., 5 s-30 and 5 s-27) overlaps, \\nand is in a similar range to the 4-story building. Furthermore, the esti-\\nmated loss reduces by the increase in the lateral weight. The predicted \\nloss  by  reduced  models  lies  within  the  prediction  plane  by  the  full \\nmodel. However, the exclusion of beam design parameters introduces \\nadditional epistemic uncertainty, resulting in the lack of information on \\nloss  variability  with  respect  to  lateral  weight.  Reduced  data-driven \\nmodels suggest that the 6-story building has the highest loss. In addi-\\ntion, the two buildings with a similar gross area (i.e., 5 s-27 and 4 s-27) \\nhave similar performance range within the same range of lateral weight, \\n\\nalbeit  5  s-27  has  a  slightly higher  loss  for  frames  with  lateral  weight \\nabove 400 tons. \\n\\n3.2.3. Physics-based surrogate modeling \\n\\nThere are several methods to map a building’s dynamic response to \\nan  equivalent  SDOF.  This  study  assumes  that  the  equivalent  SDOF’s \\nresponse  to  monotonic  load  (i.e.,  backbone  curve)  is  defined  by  a \\ntrilinear  force–deformation  [62].  As  mentioned  in  Section  2,  physics- \\nbased models require building dynamic information. Here, static push-\\nover analyses are extracted from literature [63–65] to estimate the base \\nshear  (V)  -  roof displacement  (D).  The  extracted  pushover  curves  are \\nfrom  buildings  located  in  sites  with  different  seismicity.  Therefore, \\nadditional pushover curves are generated to serve as the lower\\\\upper \\nbound V-D relationships, where the initial pushover curve is uniformly \\nscaled by the ratio of design acceleration between Charleston and the \\nselected study site. \\n\\nThe V-D relationship is then scaled by the first mode participation \\nfactor and mapped to the equivalent SDOF force (F) – displacement (Δ) \\nby balancing the area under the transformed scaled V-D relationship as \\nshown  in  Fig.  5.a  and  5.b.  Based  on  prior  research,  a  peak-oriented \\nhysteretic  model with a  cyclic deterioration parameter of 50 is  adop-\\nted [62]. The SDOF is then subjected to 80 site-specific ground motion \\nrecords, and its displacement is recorded. The estimated displacement is \\nconverted to inter-story drift values using empirical values suggested by \\nGupta and Krawinkler [42]. The drift responses are then translated to \\nloss values following the same loss approach described in Appendix II, \\nconsistent  with  other  surrogate  modeling  approaches  and  point-of- \\nreference  detailed  assessments.  Due  to  the  lack  of  well-documented \\npushover  studies  on  5-story  concrete  buildings,  this  approach  is  only \\napplied to 4- and 6-story buildings. \\n\\nAs  shown  in  Fig.  5.c,  equivalent  SDOFs  distinguish  between  loss \\nvalues  of  the  two  corresponding  topologies,  where  the  6-story  has  a \\nlarger median loss value than the 4-story buildings. Furthermore, the \\nscaling procedure results in larger loss variability for the 6-story build-\\ning than for the 4-story building. Fig. 5.c shows that the reported total \\nweight  of  the  6-story  from  reference  [64]  is  smaller  than  the  4-story \\nbuilding, possibly due to the smaller floor area. \\n\\n3.3. Surrogate modeling using complete data \\n\\nThis section develops the three discussed surrogate modeling types \\nbased on an inventory of analytical models of buildings, and compares \\nthe predicted loss values to ones from detailed models.

Zaker Esteghamati and M.M. Flint                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\n\\ndemonstrate  a  negative  trend  between  loss  and  lateral  weight,  which \\nfollows the detailed analysis only for 6 s-30 and 4 s-27 buildings. This \\nobservation is due to the smaller sample size studied here, as the data- \\ndriven  models  are  developed  based  on  an  extensive  frame  database \\nand  preserve  the  database  trend  for  design  parameters.  Therefore, \\ncaution should be made not to overly rely on a small set of data-driven \\nsurrogate models to deduce early design insights. \\n\\n3.3.3. Physics-based surrogate modeling \\n\\nInstead of approximate pushover curves (as shown in Fig. 5a and b), \\nstatic  pushover  analysis  was  performed  on  all  design  variations \\n(described  in  Appendix  I)  to  estimate  the  base  shear  (V)  -  roof \\ndisplacement (D) curve for equivalent SDOFs. An identical approach as \\nSection 3.2.3 was used to post-process results and derive loss. \\n\\nFig. 7 shows that SDOF surrogate models with complete information \\nagree  with  detailed  analysis.  On  average,  The  SDOF  models  estimate \\n9.7% and 0.2% smaller loss for 6 s-30 and 5 s-27 buildings, and 9.6% and \\n15.8% larger loss for 5 s-30 and 4 s-27 buildings, respectively. In addi-\\ntion, the data-driven and knowledge-based models provided more ac-\\ncurate  estimates  than  the  SDOF  model  when  complete  design  data  is \\navailable.  For  example,  the  SDOFs  prediction  is,  on  average,  11.9% \\nsmaller than the full data-driven models. However, it should be noted \\nthat  the  superiority  of  data-driven  models  is  due  to  being  trained  on \\nidentical building class and location. While the results motivate future \\nstatistical models trained for different systems and locations considering \\nthe  remarkably  low  effort  needed  to  use  these  models,  nonetheless, \\nSDOF surrogate models can offer a viable option to balance accuracy and \\neffort at seismic early design exploration. \\n\\nTable 3 compares the trend of predicted loss with lateral weight from \\nequivalent SDOF models and detailed analysis. The SDOFs could capture \\nthe actual trend for all topologies except for the 6 s-30 building, hence \\nare more accurate in capturing the trend than data-driven models. This \\nobservation reinforces the advantage of SDOFs in understanding design \\nparameters’ relationship with expected performance, particularly in the \\nparametrization of a limited set of design parameters. \\n\\n4.

Data-driven surrogate modeling \\n\\nIn Section 3.2.2, it was assumed that the designer has no information \\non building design and can only provide an educated guess on the range \\nof input variables. In contrast, here, the frames’ weight (for the reduced \\nmodel) and beam design information, such as average beam area and \\nreinforcement  (for  the  full-parameter  model),  are  extracted  from \\ndetailed models and fed into the support vector machines. \\n\\nFig. 7 compares the estimated loss from data-driven models to the \\nactual  loss  values  from  the  detailed  analysis.  Overall,  both  full  and \\nreduced models show reasonable accuracy. The predicted loss values of \\nthe full model are on average 4.5% larger, and 1.8%, 3.5%, and 5.1% \\nsmaller than the detailed analysis values for 6 s-30, 5 s-30, 5 s-27, and 4 s \\n(cid:0) 27  buildings,  respectively.  In  comparison,  the  reduced  model  pre-\\ndictions  are  3.6%  larger  and  4.1%,  3.9%,  and  4.5%  smaller  than  the \\ndetailed analysis values for the same buildings. \\n\\nTable  4  evaluates  whether  the  surrogate  models  could  extract  the \\nrelationship between a design parameter, here, the lateral weight and \\nloss.

Overview of the sequential framework \\n\\nThe  inherent  and  epistemic  limitations  of  different  surrogate \\nmodeling approaches motivate a framework that leverages each method \\naccording to early design stages. Fig. 8 shows the proposed sequential \\nframework and the related early design phases. The underlying concept \\n\\nof the framework is that each prior surrogate model will (partially or \\nentirely)  guide  the  parametrization  of  the  posterior  surrogate  model. \\nThe designer is assumed to deal with an initial space with considerable \\nvariability between (e.g., choices over structural and flooring systems) \\nand  within  (e.g.,  code-minimum  or  beyond-code  member  sizing) \\ndifferent  subsystems.  In  early  design  terminology,  the  convergence \\nphase refers to reducing the design space by removing unfavorable al-\\nternatives.  In  contrast,  the  divergence  phase  refers  to  expanding  the \\ndesign space with new candidate alternatives. \\n\\nIn the first cycle of convergence, the designer employs knowledge- \\n\\nFig. 9.

These \\nknowledge-based  models are  derived from  prior  assessment or  expert \\nelicitation,  ideally  structured  as  databases  for  easy  queries.  The \\nknowledge-based  model  must  provide  data  to  capture  the  trend  of  a \\ngiven performance measure for the required input for the data-driven \\nmodel.  The  early  application  of  knowledge-based  models  facilitates \\nassessing a larger number of alternatives at a low expense, and narrows \\nthe scope of the subsequent higher-fidelity statistical models. As illus-\\ntrated in Section 3, the database should have adequate data specificity \\nand balance. If not possible, it should be used to only distinguish be-\\ntween different systems than topologies. \\n\\nThe resulting reduced space is evaluated through data-driven models \\nat  the  second  convergence  cycle.  These  data-driven  models  are  con-\\nstructed  by  fitting  statistical  models  to  a  performance  inventory  that \\ndescribes  the  studied  design  space.  The  performance  inventory  that \\nenables such generalizable and accurate statistical models is obtained by \\nsampling early design parameters, developing building (or subsystem) \\nmodels for each sampled parameter set, and performing relevant per-\\nformance  assessments  such  as  loss  or  life  cycle  assessments.  While \\ncurrently,  limited  data-driven  models  exist,  the  previously  narrowed \\nspace  enables  the  user  to  derive  or  apply  approximate  models  for  a \\nlimited set of topologies and systems. This convergence cycle aims to \\naccurately  demarcate  performance  space  and  obtain  a  “feasible”  per-\\nformance range of alternatives. \\n\\nThe  designer  then  can  employ  physics-based  models  to  examine \\nseveral code-compliant design variations to further narrow performance \\nspace for each selected subsystem. The properties of these models are \\ninformed by the previous data-driven models. Although physics-based \\nsurrogate models require additional modeling efforts, they are compu-\\ntationally  inexpensive  compared  to  fully  detailed  response  history \\nanalysis. Therefore, the physics-based model can be a viable solution for \\nthe  detailed  assessment  of  a  limited  set  of  alternatives  or  to  obtain \\n“derivative” designs through parametric studies as a diverging cycle. \\n\\nAn important caveat is that while Fig. 8 shows a sequential approach, \\nthe transition between different spaces could be altered depending on \\navailable data and models. For example, if data-driven surrogate models \\nare  trained  on  similar  building  subsystems,  the  designer  might  not \\nimplement  a  physics-based  model  (which  would  be  expected  to  have \\nlower accuracy). In contrast, if data-driven models are unavailable but \\nan  abundance of prior assessment exists, the  designer might combine \\nknowledge-based  and  physics-based  models  to  drive  the  alternative \\nspace.  The  application  of  the  proposed  framework  to  the  considered \\ndesign scenarios will be discussed in the next section. For a consistent \\ncomparison, the sequential model is applied to estimate the seismic loss \\nof  4-  and  6-story  buildings.  It  should  be  noted  that  due  to  limited \\navailable data, only data-driven model output could guide the param-\\neters of the physics-based models. \\n\\n4.2. Application to the incomplete information case \\n\\nThe  sequential  framework  is  applied  to  the  presented  case  study \\nunder the limited information. Fig. 9 compares estimated performance \\n\\nranges  from  each  step  (i.e.,  surrogate  model)  of  the  sequence.  In  a \\nbroader context of early design, Fig. 9 provides a visual aid to perform \\ndesign  space  exploration,  here  shown  for  two  topologies  of  a  single \\nlateral-resisting  system.  The  horizontal  thick  and  dashed  lines  in  the \\nzoom plots show the median and two standard deviation loss values for \\nthe design variations estimated from the detailed loss assessment. The \\nresults are only presented for 4- and 6-story buildings. \\n\\nFor both 6- and 4- story office projects, the knowledge-based models \\nprovide  a  considerably  larger  range  than  other  methods,  where  the \\ndesign upper bounds are lower than the minimum values by knowledge- \\nbased surrogate models. If one only uses knowledge-based models, they \\nwill  considerably  (to  the  order  of  10-fold)  overestimate  loss  values. \\nThere  are  two  reasons  behind  this  large  discrepancy  —  first,  the \\nmaximum  value  of  the  knowledge-based  models  is  directly  obtained \\nfrom  structures  in  California  without  any  modification.  As  shown  by \\nNikelis et al. [66], the steel frames in Los Angeles could suffer seismic \\nloss values to a magnitude of 5 folds larger than those in Charleston. \\nSecond, the loss values are extrapolated for gross usable space values \\noutside the range used in developing regression models, particularly for \\nbuilding  A,  which  has  twice  the  gross  usable  space  as  the  maximum \\nvalue in Table 3. As more performance-based assessments are performed \\non  seismically  designed  structures  in  the  Eastern  US,  the  quality  of \\nknowledge-based surrogate models will be improved to narrow this gap. \\nMeanwhile, the results suggest it is more practical to use knowledge- \\nbased  surrogate  models  for  structural  system  selection  (e.g.,  concrete \\nversus  steel  frames)  than  demarcating  performance  for  a  class  of \\nbuildings  unless  adequate  data  exists  (such  as  the  case  for  the  west \\ncoast). This issue will be further discussed in the next section. \\n\\nIn  the  next  stage,  the  data  from  published  literature  was  used  to \\nconstrain  the  weight  input  parameter  of  the  data-driven  models, \\nwhereas building height and floor area were fixed based on the project \\ninformation. It should be noted that if the literature provides adequate \\ndesign  data,  all  other  parameters  of  the  data-driven  models  (e.g., \\naverage beam section) can be constrained to further guide model input. \\nAs shown in both Fig. 9, the full-parameter data-driven models provide a \\nsufficiently wide performance range that contains the design variations \\nfor both buildings. On the other hand, while the reduced model’s esti-\\nmates  represent  median  design  variations  for  both  buildings,  several \\ndesigns  fall  outside  the  estimated  range  for  the  6-story  building,  as \\nshown  in  Fig.  9.a.  This  observation  reinforces  the  intuition  that  the \\napplied data-driven model should maintain information on the design \\nvariability. If the designer develops physics-based models based on the \\nreduced model output (e.g., builds equivalent SDOF corresponding to \\nthe models’ lateral weight range), they might have false confidence in \\nthe estimated performance. On average, the predicted loss values from \\nfull-parameter  data-driven  models  are  10.1%  and  10.5%  larger  than \\ndesign variation for 6- and 4-story buildings. \\n\\nThe physics-based models are then constructed by constraining their \\nmass from the data-driven models’ upper and lower bound values and \\nvarying  their  initial  stiffness  values.  Fig.  9.a  and  9.b  show  that  the \\nphysics-based  models  provide  a  reasonable  prediction  of  loss  range, \\nparticularly compared to knowledge-based models.

This observation is intuitive as the refer-\\nence building is designed for California, resulting in a lower loss value \\nfor a site with lower seismicity. On the other hand, the equivalent SDOF \\nof  the  6-story  buildings  predicts  a  loss  range  corresponding  to  two \\nstandard  deviations higher  than the  median  design values, where the \\naverage prediction is 20.0% higher than the average loss values from \\ndetailed models. As shown in Fig. 5.c, the reference building of the 6- \\nstory SDOF has a smaller weight and fundamental period, locating the \\nstructure at higher spectral values of the design spectrum and, conse-\\nquently,  larger  loss  values.  This  observation  emphasizes  that  besides \\nsite’ seismicity, the interaction of conducted design and geometry of the \\n\\nreference building impacts the SDOFs loss prediction, altering the early \\ndesign inference. \\n\\nIn summary, the sequential application of different surrogate models \\ncan narrow the performance range and converge to possible loss value in \\nthe  lack of complete  information.  Fig. 10 compares  the results  of the \\nproposed  framework  to  the  predictions  from  other  surrogate  models \\nunder incomplete information. For the 6-story, the difference between \\nthe estimated average loss from the proposed sequential framework and \\nknowledge-based,  data-driven,  and  physics-based  models  are  96.3%, \\n1.6%%, and 9.7%, whereas, for the 4-story building, these differences \\nare 95.9%, 5.2%, 18.9%, respectively. In both cases, the guidance from \\nprior  models  led  to  improved  prediction  of  loss  expected  value  and \\nvariation in the sequential framework. \\n\\nFig. 13.

Application to the complete information case \\n\\nFig. 11 shows the sequential application of surrogate models to es-\\ntimate the performance range for the complete information case. Con-\\ntrasting  the  incomplete  case,  knowledge-based  surrogate  models \\nprovide a reasonable range that contains the median design value for \\nboth 4- and 6-story buildings. Nevertheless, the knowledge-based model \\ndoes not contain the variability of the 4-story building. This observation \\nsuggests  that  while  data  specificity  remarkably  improves  knowledge- \\nbased models’  ability to predict median loss values, data imbalance is \\ncritical in accounting for loss variability. \\n\\nData-driven  models contain median loss values from design varia-\\ntions for all geometries, whereas physics-based models over or under- \\npredict  these  values  for  6  s-30  and  5  s-30  buildings.  Both  surrogate \\nmodels  provide  a  similar  narrow  performance  range,  but  none  could \\ncapture  the  loss  variability.  Compared  to  the  incomplete  data  case, \\nsequential application of data-driven and physics-based do not provide \\nnotable improvement to narrow performance range. This conclusion is \\nmainly due to the high specificity of data-driven models and the lesser \\naccuracy of SDOFs. However, the result cannot be generalized for other \\ncases  where  non-site-specific  data-driven  models  are  implemented. \\nNevertheless,  the  results  demonstrate  the  advantage  of  implementing \\nequivalent SDOFs for parametrizing and expanding performance space, \\ninstead of pinpointing a single system’s performance value. \\n\\nFig. 12 compares the estimated loss from the sequential framework \\nto the individual surrogate models prediction under complete informa-\\ntion. For the 6-story, the difference between the estimated average loss \\nfrom  the  proposed  sequential  framework  and  knowledge-based,  data- \\ndriven,  and  physics-based  models  are  2.5%,  3.2%%,  and  24.4%, \\nwhereas,  for  the  4-story  building,  these  differences  are  7.5%,  3.1%, \\n15.9%, respectively. For both buildings, the sequential application led to \\nimproved estimation of average loss, addressing the bias issues in un-\\nguided  physics-based  models. For  the  6-story building,  the  sequential \\nframework also improved the estimation of the loss variability. \\n\\n4.4. Extrapolation beyond the trained parameter range \\n\\nThe accuracy of data-driven and knowledge-based surrogate models \\ndepends on the range of sampled parameters within the training data \\ninventory. To illustrate the effect of extrapolation, a new hypothetical 2- \\nstory  building  project  was  considered,  as  shown  in  Fig.  13a.  The  ge-\\nometry  and  design  parameters  of  this  building  are  different  from  the \\nrange of sampled parameters in the building inventory, hence requiring \\nthe  framework  to  extrapolate  beyond  the  learned  design  space.  The \\nsimulation framework presented in [13] was used to generate nine de-\\nsigns for this building as a reference, similar to Section 3.1.1. Next, in-\\ndividual  surrogate  models  and  sequential  framework  were  used  to \\nestimate EAL for the 2-story building. It should be noted that since there \\nare no 2-story building in the compiled building inventory, the regres-\\nsion model from Section 3.3.1 is used to estimate the average loss value \\nfrom the knowledge-based model. \\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 13.c, the data-driven model over predicts the losses \\nfor the 2-story building. The median loss prediction from the data-driven \\nmodels  is  38.1%  higher  than  the  observed  values  from  the  detailed \\nassessment. This overprediction is mainly due to the data-driven model \\nbeing trained on building with larger footprints that often have higher \\nloss values. In contrast, the physics-based model shows a more consis-\\ntent estimation with only a 10.1% difference from the observed values. \\nFig. 13.b shows that the over-prediction in data-driven models led the \\nsubsequent SDOFs into an inaccurate range, resulting in 46.9% bias in \\nthe  final  median  loss  estimation.  To  summarize,  when  extrapolating \\nbeyond the training data, caution should be given to using data-driven \\nmodels,  and  the  application  of  physics-based  surrogate  models  could \\nprovide higher accuracy \\n\\n5. Conclusion \\n\\n5.1. Summary \\n\\nThis study compared three surrogate modeling techniques (knowl-\\nedge-based,  data-driven,  and  simplified  physics-based  models)  for \\nseismic design exploration of concrete office buildings for a fixed loca-\\ntion.  The surrogate  models  aimed  to  predict  seismic  loss (in  terms  of \\nrepair cost) based on the frames’ design information for the entire life- \\ncycle  of  the  buildings.  Two  levels  of  available  information  were \\nconsidered  in  developing  surrogate  models  conforming  to  early  (i.e., \\nincomplete  information  including  only  the  overall  geometry  of  the \\nbuilding) and late stages (i.e., complete information on geometry and \\ndesign of frame members) of design. The impact of design data avail-\\nability on surrogate models’ estimation was investigated. Furthermore, \\na sequential framework was proposed where the underlying concept is \\nto  use  lower-fidelity  models  at  earlier  stages  with  the  least  available \\ninformation,  and  to  guide  parameters  of  the  higher-fidelity  surrogate \\nmodels at the later stages. The framework is applied to four concrete \\nframe topology construction in Charleston, South Carolina. \\n\\nThe following summarizes the main findings of this study:  \\n\\n1.  All surrogate modeling techniques provide reasonable accuracy for \\nthe complete design information case. For example, the prediction of \\nmedian loss from knowledge-based, data-driven, and physics-based \\nsurrogate  models  was  9.0%%,  4.5%,  and  9.7%  larger  than  the \\ndetailed analysis for the 6-story building.  \\n\\n2.  For the incomplete design information case, data-driven models are a \\nversatile tool to demarcate the performance space. For example, the \\nprediction of median loss from data-driven models was 10.1% and \\n10.5% larger than the detailed analysis for 6- and 4-story buildings. \\nIn contrast, the equivalent SDOFs predictions were 20.0% and 11.9% \\nlarger  and  smaller  than  the  detailed  analysis  values  for  the  same \\nbuildings. \\n\\n3. The proposed  sequential framework  converges  to expected  perfor-\\nmance  from  a  detailed  design  at  low  computational  cost,  and  its \\nadvantage is more pronounced for the incomplete information case. \\nFor example, the sequential framework resulted in 95.9% and 5.2%, \\nand  18.9%  higher  accuracy  in  predicting  seismic  loss  than  the \\nknowledge-based,  data-driven,  and  physics-based  models  under \\nincomplete information for the 4-story building.  \\n\\n4.  Knowledge-based  surrogate  models  should  be  developed  based  on \\nsite-specific databases with balanced data for the incomplete infor-\\nmation  case.  The  non-specificity  of  knowledge-based  surrogate \\nmodels could result in shortsighted estimates that woefully mislead \\nthe designer. \\n\\n5. As the size of studies design alternatives shrinks, physics-based sur-\\nrogate  models  become  more  effective  than  data-driven  models  in \\nextracting the relationship between design parameters and seismic \\nloss.  \\n\\n6.  The accuracy of studied data-driven models largely depends on the \\ntraining data’s sampled input range. In contrast, equivalent SDOFs \\nshow higher accuracy than data-driven models for the cases where \\nthe  designer  extrapolates  beyond  the  training  data  of  data-driven \\nmodels. \\n\\n5.2. Limitations and future work \\n\\nSeveral limitations of the current study are as follows:  \\n\\n• The  data-driven  surrogate  models  trained  on  a  large  performance \\ninventory consistent with the candidate system and site seismicity \\nprovide the most accurate result at a very low computational cost; \\nalthough it is unlikely that the designer has access to such models. \\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  framework  results  to  data-driven  models \\nderived from other databases should be further explored. \\n\\nEngineeringStructures286(2023)11609811\\x0cM.

A resilient design encompasses different per-\\nformance metrics, such as life-cycle cost and recovery, while accounting \\nfor  the  building’s  interaction  with  its  surrounding  infrastructure. \\nTherefore,  the  ability  to  track  the  effect  of  design  decisions  on  these \\nperformance metrics over a single building is a necessary first step to \\nachieving community resilience. \\n\\nProviding access to building models and data is the first step toward \\nfacilitating  and  improving  surrogate  modeling-based  approaches  in \\nearly  design.  Understandably,  sharing  models  is  not  always  feasible; \\nhence, providing critical data that allows for surrogate model develop-\\nment is recommended. In the context of concrete frames, the authors \\nidentified that the following information is critical for knowledge-based \\nsurrogate models: building weight, lateral frames weight, design codes, \\nand  requirements,  exact  location  and  general  topology,  raw  response \\nhistory results (EDP-IM pairs), or fitted model, collapse determination \\nmethod and its distribution properties. For equivalent SDOF surrogate \\nmodels, information on first mode participation factor, mass, and ideally \\nstatic pushover analysis results is critical. Further research is needed on \\ndata-driven models for a class of buildings to identify all data needs. A \\ngood  practice  could  be  to  share  the  dataset  used  to  train  statistical \\nmodels  as  supplementary  material.  Authors  can  also  provide  hyper-\\nparameters of trained models for reproducibility. \\n\\nIn the authors’ opinion, the ultimate goal of performance-based early \\ndesign is to have comprehensive performance databases with sufficient \\ngranularity to quickly locate similar designs and perform divergence and \\n\\nFig. A1.

However, there are more refined methodolo-\\ngies (e.g., using the result of adaptive pushover analysis to derive the \\nbackbone curve) that can be employed. Exploring such techniques \\ncould be a valuable future research direction.  \\n\\n• The results of this study are limited to a single class of building and \\nlocation.

The first author appreci-\\nates the additional support provided by the “Disaster Resilience and Risk \\nManagement program” at Virginia Tech.  \\n\\nAppendix I:. Seismic analysis and modeling information \\n\\nHazard information was obtained from the USGS Unified Hazard Tool, and a log–log interpolation was implemented to derive spectral acceleration \\nbased on the fundamental period of the dynamic model. A simulation package was used to generate hazard-consistent GMs through a stochastic \\nmethod based on probabilistic hazard analysis of South Carolina with the explicit treatment of wave propagation in the coastal plain [13]. \\n\\nDesign variations were the product of a previously developed framework [13], which auto-generates TCL scripts of two-dimensional nonlinear \\nmodels for concrete frame buildings based on the user’s input topology. These scripts were then loaded in OpenSees computational framework to \\nassess buildings seismic behavior. The nonlinear model uses elastic members with plastic hinges at both ends for all frame members. The plastic hinge \\nis defined with peak-oriented hysteretic behavior, where the trilinear backbone curve is defined using regression models proposed by Hasleton et al. \\n[69]. In all analytical models, P-delta effects are included using the leaning column concept. Concrete is defined with Concrete01 material with 5 ksi \\ncomprehensive strength, whereas steel is defined as Steel01 materials with 240 ksi yield strength. Additionally, pushover analysis using ASCE 7 [59] \\ntriangular load pattern were performed to derive base shear- roof drift relationship for physics-based models. Fig. A.1 shows the pushover curves of the \\ndesign variations for 4- and 6-story topologies. \\n\\nTable A1 provides the general description for reference building design. \\n\\nAppendix II. Loss assessment methodology \\n\\nAn assembly-based approach [70] is used to relate structural response to seismic loss in terms of direct repair cost associated with drift-related \\nresponse (i.e., structural and non-structural drift sensitive assemblies). In this approach, the total seismic loss (LT) is disintegrated into collapse- \\nrelated (LC) and non-collapse (LNC) losses as follows: \\nE(LT |IM) = E(LNC|IM)(1 (cid:0) P(C|IM) ) + E(LC|IM)P(C|IM)\\n\\n(1)  \\n\\nwhere IM is earthquake record intensity measure, E(X|Y) shows the expected value of random variable X conditioned on random variable Y, and P(X) \\nshows the probability of random variable X. Collapse-related loss is associated with building experiencing an inter-story drift over 10% or numerical \\ninstability. Non-collapse loss is obtained by summing up losses due to structural and drift-sensitive structural losses, where each loss is calculated as \\nfollows [71]: \\n\\nE(DV|DSi)P(DSi|EDP)P(EDP|IM)dEDP\\n\\n(2)  \\n\\n(cid:0)\\n\\nE\\n\\nLj|NC, IM\\n\\n∑m\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n\\ni=1\\n\\n∫\\n\\nwhere DV, DS, and EDP show decision variables (repair cost), damage state, and engineering demand parameters. Here, EDP is calculated from \\ndynamic analysis, DS is calculated by fitting lognormal distribution to EDP-IM pairs, and DV information is obtained from HAZUS guidelines [72]. \\n\\nReferences \\n\\n[1] Shahtaheri Y, Flint MM, Jesús M.

\\n\\nForeword \\n\\nThis  European  Standard  EN  1993,  Eurocode  3:  Design  of steel  structures,  has  been  prepared  by  Technical \\nCommittee  CEN/TC250  « Structural  Eurocodes  »,  the  Secretariat  of which  is  held  by  BSI.  CEN/TC250  is \\nresponsible for  all  Structural Eurocodes. \\n\\nThis European Standard shall  be  given the  status of a National Standard, either by publication  of an  identical \\ntext or by endorsement, at  the  latest by November 2005,  and  conflicting National  Standards  shall be  withdrawn \\nat latest by March 2010. \\n\\nThis Eurocode supersedes ENV 1993-1-1. \\n\\nAccording  to  the  CEN-CENELEC  Internal  Regulations,  the  National  Standard  Organizations  of  the \\nfollowing  countries  are  bound  to  implement  these  European  Standard:  Austria,  Belgium,  Cyprus,  Czech \\nRepublic,  Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Ircland,  Italy,  Latvia, \\nLithuania,  Luxembourg,  Malta,  Netherlands, Norway,  Poland,  Portugal,  Slovakia,  Slovenia,  Spain,  Swedcn, \\nSwitzerland and United Kingdom. \\n\\nBackground of the  Eurocode programme \\n\\nIn  1975,  the  Commission  of the  European  Community  decided  on  an  action  programme  111  the  field  of \\nconstruction,  based  on  article  95  of the  Treaty.  The  objective  of the  programme  was  the  elimination  of \\ntechnical  obstacles to trade and the  harmonization of technical  speci1~cations. \\n\\nWithin  this  action programme,  the  Commission  took  the  initiative to  establish  a set of harmonized  technical \\nrules for the  design of construction works which,  in  a first  stage,  would  serve as  an  alternativc to  the  national \\nrules in  force  in  the Member States and,  ultimately, would  replace them. \\n\\nFor fifteen  years,  the  Commission,  with  the  help  of a  Stcering  Committee  with  Representatives  of Member \\nStates,  conducted  the  development  of  the  Eurocodes  programme,  which  led  to  the  first  generation  of \\nEuropean codes  in  the  1980s. \\n\\nIn  1989, the Commission and the Member States of the  EU  and EFTA decided, on  the  basis of an  agreement I \\nbetween  the  Commission  and  CEN,  to  transfer  the  preparation  and  the  publication  of the  Eurocodes  to  the \\nCEN through a series of Mandates,  in  order to  provide them with a future  status  of European  Standard (EN). \\nThis  links  de facto  the  Eurocodes  with  the  provisions  of all  the  Council\\'s  Directives  and/or  Commission\\'s \\nDecisions dealing with  European  standards  (e.g.  the  Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC  on  construction products \\n~ CPD  ~ and  Council  Directives  93/37/EEC,  92/50/EEC  and  89/440/EEC  on  public  works  and  services  and \\nequivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the  internal market). \\n\\nThe  Stluctural  Eurocode  programme  comprises  the  following  standards  generally  consisting of a number of \\nParts: \\n\\nEN  1990  Eurocode: \\n\\nBasis of structural design \\n\\nEN  1991  Eurocode  1:  Actions on structures \\n\\nEN  1992  Eurocode 2:  Design of concrete structures \\n\\nEN  1993  Eurocode 3:  Design of steel stluctures \\n\\nEN  1994  Eurocode 4:  Design of composite steel and concrete structures \\n\\nEN  1995  Eurocode 5:  Design of timber stluctures \\n\\nEN 1996  Eurocode 6:  Design of masonry  structures \\n\\nEN  ]997  Eurocode 7:  Geotechnical design \\n\\nEN  1998  Eurocode 8:  Design of structures for  earthquake resistance \\n\\nI  Agreement  between  the  Commission  of the  European  Communities  and  the  European  Committee  for  Standardisation  (CEN) \\n\\nconcerning the work on  EUROCODES for the design  of building and  civil engineering works (Bc/CEN/03/89). \\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\x0cBS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005  (E) \\nEN  ] 999  Eurocode 9:  Design of aluminium structures \\n\\nEurocode  standards  recognize  the  responsibility  of regulatory  authorities  in  each  Member  State  and  have \\nsafeguarded  their right  to  determine  values  related to  regulatory  safety  matters  at  national  level  where  these \\ncontinue to vary  from State to  State. \\n\\nStatus and field  of application of Eurocodes \\n\\nThe  Member  States  of the  EU  and  EFTA  recognize  that  Eurocodes  serve  as  reference  documents  for  the \\nfonowing purposes: \\n\\nas  a  means  to  prove compliance of building  and  civil  engineering works  with  the  essential  requirements \\nof Council  Directive  89/1 06/EEC,  particularly  Essential  Requirement  N° 1  - Mechanical  resistance  and \\nstability - and Essential  Requirement N°2  Safety in  case of fire; \\n\\nas a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; \\n\\nas  a  framework  for  drawing up  harmonized  technical  specifications  for  construction  products  (ENs  and \\nETAs) \\n\\nThe Eurocodes,  as  far as  they  concern the construction  works themselves, have a  direct relationship  with the \\nInterpretative Documents 2  referred  to  in  Article  12  of the  CPD, although  they  are of a  different nature from \\nharmonized  product  standard 3\\n.  Therefore,  technical  aspects  arising  from  the  Eurocodes  work  need  to  be \\nadequately  considered  by  CEN  Technical  Committees  and/or EOTA  Working  Groups  working  on product \\nstandards with a view to achieving a full  compatibility of these technical  specifications with the Eurocodes. \\n\\nThe  Eurocode  standards  provide  common  structural  design  rules  for  everyday  use  for  the  design  of whole \\nstructures  and  component  products  of  both  a  traditional  and  an  innovative  nature.  Unusual  forms  of \\nconstruction  or  design  conditions  are  not  specifically  covercd  and  additional  expert  consideration  will  be \\nrequired by  the designer in  such cases. \\n\\nNational Standards implementing Eurocodes \\n\\nThe National  Standards implementing Eurocodes will  comprise  the  full  text  of the  Eurocode (including  any \\nwhich  may  be preceded by  a National title  page and National  foreword,  and \\nannexes), as published by \\nmay be  followed  by a National annex (informative). \\n\\nThe National  Annex (informative) may  only  contain  information  on  those parameters which  are  left open in \\nthe  Eurocode  for  national choice,  known  as  Nationally Determined Parameters,  to  be  used  for  the  design  of \\nbuildings and civil  engineering works to  be constructed in  the country concerned, i.e.  : \\n\\nvalues for partial factors  and/or classes whcre alternatives are given in  the Eurocode, \\n\\nvalues to be used where a symbol only is given in  the Eurocode~ \\n\\ngeographical and climatic data specific to the Member State, e.g.  snow map, \\n\\nthe procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in  the Eurocode, \\n\\nreferences to  non-contradictory complementary information to  assist the user to apply the Eurocode. \\n\\nLinks  between  Eurocodes and  product harmonized technical  specifications (ENs \\n\\n(\\'\"\".-rill-\\'\" to  Art.  3 _3  of the  CPD,  the essential  requirements (ERs) shall be \\n\\nconcrete form  in  interpretative documents for the \\n\\ncreation of tile  necessary  Jinks  betwcen the essential  requirements and  the  mandates  tor hENs  and  ETAGsiETAs. \\n\\nAccording to Art.  12  of the CPD the  interpretative documents  shall  : \\na) \\n\\nconcrete form  to  the essential \\n\\nharmonizing the  t\"\\'·\",,,,,,,I,,,n(  and  the  technical  bases and  indicating classes \\n\\nb) \\n\\nthese  classes  or  levels  of  requirement  with  the  technical \\n\\ne.g.  methods  of \\n\\ncalculation and \\n\\ntechnical  rules  for \\n\\ndesign. etc.  ; \\n\\nwhere  necessary; \\n\\nc)  serve as  a reference for the establishment \\nThe Eurocodes, de \\n\\nplaya similar role  in  the  field  of the  ER  1 and  a part ofER 2. \\n\\nstandards and  guidelines for  European technical  approvals. \\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\x0cBS EN 1993-1-1:2005 \\nEN 1993-1-1:2005 (E) \\n\\nand  ETAs) \\n\\nThere  is  a  need  for  consistency  between  the  harmonized  technical  specifications  for  construction  products \\nand  the  technical  rulcs  for  works4\\n.

Utilising new technologies including the internet of\\nthings (IoT) and digital twin (DT) can signiﬁcantly reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs. An\\ninfrastructure DT involves its digital replica and must include data on geometric, geospatial reference,\\nperformance, attributes (material, environment etc.) and management. Then, the acquired data need\\nto be analysed and visualised to inform maintenance decision making. To develop this DT, the ﬁrst\\nstep is the study of the infrastructure life cycle to design DT architecture. Using data semantics,\\nthis paper presents a novel DT architecture design for an intelligent infrastructure maintenance\\nsystem. Semantic modelling is used as a powerful tool to structure and organize data. This approach\\nprovides an industry context through capturing knowledge about infrastructures in the structure of\\nsemantic model graph. Using new technologies, DT approach derives and presents meaningful data\\non infrastructure real-time performance and maintenance requirements, and in a more expressible\\nand interpretable manner. The data semantic model will guide when and what data to collect for\\nfeeding into the infrastructure DT. The proposed DT concept was applied on one of the conveyors\\nof Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal in Queensland Australia to monitor the structural performance in\\nreal-time, which enables predictive maintenance to avoid breakdowns and disruptions in operation\\nand consequential ﬁnancial impacts.\\nKeywords: digital twin; internet of things; architecture design; data semantic modelling; intelligent\\ninfrastructure maintenance\\n1. Introduction\\nIncreasing utilisation and aging infrastructure has resulted in the requirement for\\ninfrastructure assets continuous health monitoring [1].\\nThere are about 22,500 bridges in Australia with a replacement cost of around AUD\\n3 billion , and an annual maintenance expenditure of about AUD 300 million [ 2]. The United\\nStates Federal Highway Administration incurs a bi-annual inspection cost of AUD 3.4 billion\\nwhere the average inspection cost for each bridge structure is AUD 5500 to 12,500.\\nThe architecture, engineering and construction industries combined worldwide an-\\nnual expenditure is more than AUD 10 trillion. These industries are globally the largest\\nconsumers of raw material, and their built assets are responsible for 25 to 40% of the world’s\\ntotal carbon emissions [ 3]. Furthermore, according to the World Bank, demand for civil\\ninfrastructure exceeds supply at a shortfall of AUD one trillion every year [3].\\nA total of 65% to 85% of the facility management cost is spent for their maintenance\\nand yet there is not an efﬁcient management and decision making strategy to optimise\\nthis cost [ 4]. In facility maintenance management, there are two main issues with existing\\nfacility management systems [4]:\\n\\x0f inability of computerised maintenance management systems or, in other words, facility\\nmanagement systems to automatically schedule maintenance work orders\\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 8664. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148664\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 8664 2 of 25\\n\\x0f difﬁculty in accessing accurate information for the facility management staff.\\nThe mentioned shortcomings are applicable to asset maintenance management of\\nalmost all other disciplines (i.e., structures, utilities, production plants etc.).\\nExisting practices in infrastructure health monitoring rely either upon site inspections\\n(level 1, 2 and 3 for bridges, for example) and abstract software to obtain, store and process\\nthe acquired data. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the currently in practice infrastructure\\nmaintenance management processes.\\nSustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26', metadata={})"

A  reduction  in  these \\nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  achieved  by  recovering  building  waste  through  selective \\ndeconstruction and material reuse. Unfortunately, recycling is the most common practice in the \\nwaste management hierarchy, and it is not as energy- and material-efficient as reuse. Therefore, \\nreuse should be promoted for better waste management and efficient use of materials. The built \\nenvironment can take advantage of circular economy and digitalization principles to promote \\nreuse practices. However, the absence of an established decision-making framework to identify \\nreusable structural elements and the lack of initiatives to adopt advanced technologies for reuse \\nslow down the practical implementation in the built environment.  \\n\\nIn  this  thesis,  a  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  is  developed  with  an  automated \\nconvolutional neural network tool that recognizes corrosion, connection types and associated \\ndamage  from  steel  structure  images,  with  an  overall  accuracy  of  83%,  89%,  and  83%, \\nrespectively. To validate the tool and demonstrate the potential of the research, the decision-\\nmaking framework is applied to a case study of steel frame building from a real-world reuse \\nproject. The framework refers to the feasibility of decisions around reusing structural elements \\nfrom  end-of-life  buildings,  and  depending  on  the  reuse  percentage,  it  indicated  that  up  to \\n106,000 kgCO2e can be saved from reuse practice for the considered case study. \\n\\nThis  framework  is  intended  to  provide  a  strong  supportive  system  to  the  stakeholders  and \\ndecision-makers  in  the  built  environment.  As  a  result,  it  reduces  the  risk  and  uncertainties \\nassociated with reusing structural elements from end-of-life building stock. Finally, efficient \\ndecision-making can positively contribute to the goal of reducing GHG emissions caused by \\nthe Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The method developed in this \\nthesis can also be extended to other building types to further facilitate the reuse of components \\nand materials widely used in the industry. \\n\\nKeywords: Circular Economy, Material reuse, Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural \\nNetwork, Decision making, Risk mitigation \\n\\ni \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \\n\\nFirst, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Alper Kanyilmaz, \\nfor his continuous guidance, support, and insightful mentoring throughout the thesis work.

INTRODUCTION \\n\\nThe  building  construction  and  operation  are  the  most  significant  activities  driving  current \\nenergy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, representing 36% of total energy \\nuse  and  37%  of  the  global  GHG  emissions,  respectively  (Figure  1)  (UNEP,  2021). \\nApproximately,  10%  of  these  emissions  are  related  to  the  carbon  emissions  caused  by  the \\nproduction of materials in buildings – the so-called embodied carbon (Le Den X et al., 2022). \\nBesides, construction activities consume a significant amount of natural resources, and produce \\nthe highest amount of waste among all other sectors (BIO Intelligence Service, 2013). As a \\nresult,  the  construction  industry  is  under  more  scrutiny  than  ever  to  reduce  resource \\nconsumption, construction, and demolition-related waste.  \\n\\nFigure 1. Building and construction’s global share of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in 2020 (UNEP, 2021) \\n\\nEmbodied carbon has long been a hidden part of a building’s climate impact, as many climate \\npolicies and reduction initiatives focus on the operational emissions related to the use of the \\nbuilding. Gathering data from multiple sources, and case studies in five European countries, \\n(Le Den X et al., 2022) show that the current amount of embodied carbon emissions in a new \\nbuilding is 600 kgCO2e/m2 on average, of that 70% of this embodied carbon is emitted upfront, \\nduring  the  building  production  and  construction  (A1-A5  life  cycle)  stages.  Moreover, \\nembodied carbon emissions in new buildings are continuing to increase.  \\n\\nIn recent years, since the signing of the Paris agreement (Unfccc, 2015), CO2 emissions from \\nthe building and construction sector have peaked and then subsequently fallen to 2007 levels \\nin 2020 (UNEP, 2021). However, the current decline, according to the report, is due mostly to \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lower amount of economic activities. Evidently, \\nthe  transformative,  long-term  progress  in  decarbonizing  the  construction  sector  remains \\nlimited. Therefore, it is important to target the reduction of embodied carbon in buildings to \\nmeet  global  frameworks  such  as  the  Paris  agreement  (Unfccc,  2015),  and  United  Nations’ \\nsustainable development goals (UN, 2021). \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  some  emission  reduction  policies,  initiatives,  and  codes  are  being \\nimplemented apart from the global frameworks. For instance, many initiatives at the European \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\nCommission level such as the European Green Deal (European Commission, 2022a), the EU \\nCircular Economy Action Plan (European Commission, 2022b), the New European Bauhaus \\n(European Union, 2022) and recently the EU Taxonomy (EU Technical Expert, 2020) have \\nbeen developed (Teuffel P., 2022). The future impact of these initiatives is evident in reducing \\nthe current emissions, enhancing the energy efficiency of the building industry, and promoting \\nenvironmental  sustainability.  For  example,  according  to  the  EU  taxonomy  regulation  (EU \\nTechnical Expert, 2020), the transition to the circular economy is among the six environmental \\nobjectives  which  an  economic  activity  has  to  meet  in  order  to  qualify  as  environmentally \\nsustainable.  \\n\\nA circular economy of the built environment is a topic of increasing interest to academics and \\npractitioners.  Mimicking  processes  observed  in  nature,  circular  economies  are  systems  in \\nwhich materials at the end of their service lives (Figure 2) become resources for new growth  \\n(McFarland et al., 2021). Similarly, a circular economy has been defined as “a regenerative \\nsystem in which resource input, waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, \\nclosing, and narrowing material and energy loops” (Figure 3) (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). To \\nthat  end,  building  renovation  of  existing  buildings  or  adaptive  reuse  of  materials  and \\ncomponents of a building can contribute to slowing down the resource consumption and the \\nnegative environmental impact due to material disposal, and new manufacturing. \\n\\nFigure 2. Steel structure construction waste problem (GreenSpec, 2022) \\n\\nInherently,  the  EU  taxonomy  regulation  (EU  Technical  Expert,  2020)  provides  the  base \\nguidelines for new assets in the circular economy framework. Accordingly, new assets should \\ncomprise at least 50% (either by weight or by the surface area of building elements) from a \\ncombination  of  reused  components,  recycled  content,  or  responsibly  sourced  renewable \\nmaterials. Furthermore, the 50% should be reached with the minimum of 15% coming from \\nreused components, another minimum 15% from recycled content and the remaining 20% from \\neither reused or recycled or renewable materials or any combination of these three. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\nFigure 3. Circular economy flowchart (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2022)  \\n\\nAnother contributing factor that can have a significant impact on facilitating a circular economy \\nand  sustainability  is  digitalization.  WBCSD  (2021)  demonstrates  the  critical  role  of \\ndigitalization in establishing sustainable practices in the building and construction sector. It is \\nevident  that  digitalization  can  improve  sustainability  performance  and  help  develop  new \\nprocesses,  services,  and  markets.  Furthermore,  adopting  new  technologies  is  one  of  the \\nindispensable factors to reach the 2050 decarbonisation target (McKinsey & Company, 2022). \\n\\nIn conclusion, circular economy and digitalization being among the leading factors that can \\nhelp achieve sustainability goals, the reuse rate in the construction industry can be facilitated \\nthrough  wide  range  practices  of  dismantling  end-of-life  building  stocks  and  circulating  the \\nmaterial and elements in the life cycle of new buildings. Furthermore, (Çetin et al., 2021) show \\nhow the circular economy can be realized with the help of the advanced digital technologies \\nsuch  as  big  data  and  analytics,  blockchain  technology,  artificial  intelligence,  digital \\nmarketplace,  internet  of  things  (IoT)  and  others  to  visualize,  analyse,  track,  and  record  the \\nhistory as well as the future fate of materials and elements from end-of-life buildings, and make \\nthem available for the new projects. \\n\\n1.1. The role of structural engineers to reduce emissions and promote sustainability \\n\\nThe  pressing  challenge  of  climate  change,  carbon  emissions  and  significant  resource \\nconsumption  need  special  attention  and  unwavering  contribution  from  the  construction \\nindustry. For this, the emissions from materials and construction processes should be urgently \\naddressed to ensure that the built environment is optimized for low-carbon solutions across the \\nfull building life cycle. The reduction in embodied carbon and resource consumption, as well \\nas  other  environmental  impacts,  can  be  achieved  by  recovering  building  waste  caused  by \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\ndemolition  through  material  reuse,  recycling  or  building  repurposing  through  selective \\ndeconstruction and building system reuse (Assefa & Ambler, 2017). Moreover, case studies \\naround the world show that a significant portion of the debris can be recycled and reused during \\nthe clean-up phases to reduce the volume of the debris disposed into landfill sites and eliminates \\nsome of the need for site remediation before new construction. \\n\\nSimilarly,  the  role  of  professionals  in  the  construction  industry  is  essential.  Institution  of \\nStructural  Engineers (2020) presents  the scale of impacts  of  average structural  engineers in \\nreducing carbon emissions in comparison to the average citizens (Figure 4). This can be evident \\nthrough maximizing refurbishment of existing buildings, evaluating each design choice using \\na whole life-cycle approach, and seeking to minimize upfront carbon impacts. The collective \\neffort of these will in turn help avoid future embodied carbon during and at the end-of-life in \\nmaximizing the potential for renovation, future adaptation, and circularity. \\n\\nFigure 4. The impact of structural engineers in reducing CO2 emissions (Institution of Structural Engineers, 2020) \\n\\nOn the other hand, new buildings can also  be designed in  such a way that  facilitates future \\nadaptation. Adaptability has been defined as “the ease with which a building can be physically \\nmodified, deconstructed, refurbished, reconfigured, repurposed and/or expanded” (Ross et al., \\n2016). In practice, adaptability could be pre-configured in the design phase so that the buildings \\nmay be easily altered to future needs. \\n\\n1.2. Current challenges of the construction industry in promoting reuse  \\n\\nEven  if  the  guidelines  and  the  initiatives  that  are  taken  by  the  leading  above-mentioned \\nEuropean  Union  frameworks,  the  construction  industry  still  has  to  do  more  in  reducing  the \\nembodied carbon emissions, resource consumption and demolition related waste output. The \\nenvironmental impact of reusing elements is evaluated by academic studies (Brütting, de Wolf, \\net al., 2019) (Minunno et al., 2020) (Hoxha & Fivet, 2018) (de Wolf C et al., 2018) (Assefa & \\nAmbler, 2017). However, the overall reuse rate is not in a streamline and is declining in recent \\nyears, especially in the UK (Densley Tingley et al., 2017). This is primarily due to two major \\nfactors. \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\n•  The knowledge gap in academic studies on how to identify reusable structural elements. \\nMany of the literature in the built environment advocates reuse solely from life-cycle \\nimpact assessment but do not provide a framework on how to analyse the risk associated \\nwith reusing structural elements and show directions on how to reduce the uncertainties.  \\n\\n•  The lack of initiatives to adopt digital technologies in promoting reuse practice in the \\nindustry.  Even  if  the  significant  positive  impact  of  digitalization  in  achieving  the \\nsustainability goals and decarbonization target, the construction industry is by far the \\nleast digitized sector than others (McKinsey & Company, 2016).  \\n\\nApart from the knowledge gap and the lack of initiatives to adopt digital technologies in the \\nindustry, the societal and political situation could also play an important role in retarding the \\nreuse  practice  as  well  as  in  reducing  the  CO2  emission  from  the  construction  industry.  For \\ninstance,  people  generally  have  negative  opinions  toward  second-hand  materials,  and  it  is \\nbelieved that newly manufactured components  are much more valuable than the used ones. \\nFurthermore, the construction industry, being a highly fragmented sector, is conservative to \\nadopt new practices. \\n\\n1.3. Possible solutions for the current challenges in promoting reuse \\n\\nThe two above-mentioned current challenges in the construction industry can be addressed with \\ntwo possible solutions. The first challenge requires a multi-criteria decision-making framework \\nthat  evaluates  the  reuse  potential  of  structural  elements  considering  the  associated  factors. \\nSecondly, incorporating advanced digital technologies can help facilitate reuse by automating \\npart of the framework, reducing cost, and increasing reliability. \\n\\n1.3.1.  Decision-making criteria for reuse \\n\\nThe decision on what should happen to the existing buildings is complex and involves a range \\nof  stakeholders  and  decision-makers  (Baker  et  al.,  2017).  Engineers,  architects,  planners, \\nproject developers, urban designers and environmental managers often have different priorities \\nin the decision-making process. Decision-making criteria tools are often designed to balance \\nthese multiple requirements/priorities and find the most optimized solution in a given possible \\noutcome domain. These tools are even more promising in getting the global optima solution in \\na significant and oftentimes tedious solution-searching process that involves various complex \\nand non-fully overlapping multi-dimensional domains (Kanyilmaz et al., 2022). \\n\\nAssessing the reuse potential of structural elements depends on different factors, some can be \\nmeasured accurately while others involve a certain degree of estimation. Even if the output of \\nthe  analysis  is  not  always  exact,  it  is  obvious  that  reuse  evaluation  should  not  be  done \\narbitrarily. Moreover, the professional and personal experience of the reuse auditor, including \\nthe  skills  developed  through  prior  experience  are  generally  valuable  (FCRBE,  2020). \\nTherefore,  developing  a  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  helps  newcomers  and \\ninterested stakeholders on how to assess reusable structural elements considering the associated \\nfactors.  \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\nFigure 5 (FCRBE, 2020) shows how the collection of information and the reuse inventory is \\nbeing used to assess the reuse potential of soon-to-be demolished or end-of-life buildings. Even \\nif  it  is  not  possible  to  reuse  all  elements,  managing  an  efficient  demolition  related  waste \\ntreatment  and  high-grade  recycling  is  expected  as  part  of  the  contribution  for  the  circular \\neconomy. \\n\\nMore  thorough  decision-making  framework  will  increase  the  extent  to  which  structural \\nelements can be reused and as well, inform building owners and contractors when various reuse \\nalternatives should be investigated. This proper consideration, as a result, will reduce the cost \\nof evaluation and increase the effectiveness of any reuse practice.  \\n\\nFigure 5. Reuse audit procedure (FCRBE, 2020) \\n\\n1.3.2.  Artificial intelligence and the circular economy \\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has a huge potential to facilitate and achieve the goals of the circular \\neconomy (Noman et al., 2022). According to (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2021), there are \\nmany opportunities for AI to help streamline the infrastructure needed to circulate materials in \\nthe economy - many of them focusing on the ability of AI algorithms to recognise and identify \\nobjects using cameras and other sensors. Three ways AI can impact the circular economy are:  \\n\\ni.  Automated  assessment:  automated  condition  assessment  of  used  products,  and \\nrecommendation  for  whether  they  can  be  reused,  resold,  repaired  or  recycled  to \\nmaximize value preservation. \\n\\nii.  Automated disassembly:  automated disassembly of used products  employing  AI to \\nassess  and  adjust  the  disassembly  equipment  settings  based  on  the  condition  and \\nposition of a product.  \\n\\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\niii. \\n\\nSorting: sorting of post-consumer mixed material streams using AI visual recognition \\ntechniques combined with robotics.  \\n\\nSeveral  machine  learning  and  deep  learning  algorithms  have  been  proved  to  provide  an \\nefficient problem solving methods in the built environment. Specific domains of AI such as \\nComputer Vision has also been applied on various civil engineering applications to automate \\ninspection monitoring  of critical  infrastructures through  visual inspection (Harirchian et  al., \\n2021), structural element recognition (Zhu et al., 2010), damage detection and classification \\n(Jahanshahi & Masri, 2012). \\n\\nGiven the huge potential of AI in promoting the circular economy, its application can also be \\nextended to reuse of materials in the built environment. For this, machine learning models can \\nbe trained and validated to automate the preliminary condition assessment of reusable elements \\nfrom  structural  image  data.  Adopting  these  techniques  will  in  turn  overcome  the  high \\nidentification and analysis cost and increase reliability. Furthermore, as the number of images \\nthat can be collected increases with the advent of technologies and the ever-increasing use of \\ncamera-equipped  devices  such  as  drones  (UAVs),  ground  robots,  smartphones,  tablets  etc, \\nthese AI based tools in the computer vision subdomain, such as convolutional neural network \\n(CNN),  becomes  vital  to  extract  meaningful  information  by  detecting,  identifying,  and \\nclassifying various reusable elements present in an image. To that end, automating these tasks, \\nwould also make it easier for non-professional building owners to evaluate their end-of-life \\nbuilding assets for reuse.  \\n\\n1.4. Thesis objectives \\n\\nThe main objective of this thesis is to facilitate the reuse of structural elements and components \\nin buildings and to help establish a circular economy of the built environment. The objective \\nof  the  thesis  is  addressed  by  creating  a  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  that \\nincorporates  an  automated  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  tool  that  recognizes  the \\ncorrosion level, connection types, and associated damages from steel structure images. The aim \\nof the CNN tool is to pave the way to adopt machine learning algorithms for reuse and reduce \\nthe high identification and analysis cost in the preliminary reuse assessment stage. The decision \\nmaking framework has been validated with a case study steel frame building and demonstrated \\nthat  reuse  is  the  most  efficient  and  feasible  alternative  for  the  end-of-life  building,  and  it \\nindicated that up to 106,000 kgCO2e can be saved from reuse practice for the considered case \\nstudy. \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\n2.  STATE OF THE ART \\n\\nExisting literature offers many recommendations for minimizing the environmental impact of \\nthe built environment. A potential means to implement this goal is to reuse structural elements. \\nThe  quest  for  sustainability  in  different  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  the  built \\nenvironment, is better understood, and researched using broader economy-wide concepts such \\nas Circular Economy  and place-based material and energy flow solutions such as Industrial \\nSymbiosis (Assefa & Ambler, 2017). In the other study from Poland, circular economy, as used \\nin  the  European  Union,  is  presented  as  an  economy  that  ideally  eliminates  waste  while \\nmaintaining the added value in products in a closed loop (Smol et al., 2015). \\n\\nSome European countries have introduced policies to reduce the carbon emission from the built \\nenvironment.  For  instance,  (UNEP,  2021)  discussed  the  recent  developments  in  the  latest \\npolicy and data development in Europe to reduce embodied carbon in buildings. Even though \\nthe efforts that have so far been done were with voluntary measures, various provisions have \\nnow been put in place across European cities, regions, and countries in the form of certification \\nsystems,  regulations,  standards,  and  guidelines.  For  instance,  the  Dutch  Government  has \\ncurrently  adopted  a  commitment  to  Circular  Building  within  the  EU  framework.  The \\nNetherlands has committed itself to a 50% Circularity in 2030 and a full Circularity in 2050 \\n(Governments of Netherlands, 2021). This means that apart from energy neutrality, also a large \\nshift in material use is inevitable. Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted the Life \\ncycle thinking and Circularity principle to make buildings less carbon-intensive over their full \\nlife cycle (European Commission, 2020). \\n\\nA full life cycle of carbon includes carbon emissions arising from the built environment during \\nboth  the  use  of  the  buildings  (operational  emissions)  and  their  construction  (embodied \\nemissions) (Le Den X et al., 2022). To better tackle the latter emissions, reusing and recycling \\nbuilding components and elements have shown a significant advantage from the environmental \\nperspective.  Moreover,  the  circular  economy  perspective  and  the  advent  of  advanced \\ntechnologies  play a vital  role in  realizing  reuse and recycling in  the built  environment, and \\nultimately achieving sustainability goals. \\n\\n2.1.  The value of reuse/repurpose \\n\\nConstruction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. 50% of \\nthe  total  material  use  in  Europe  is  also  associated  with  buildings  and  infrastructures  (BIO \\nIntelligence Service, 2013). The improving economic, social, and environmental indicators of \\nsustainable  development  are  drawing  attention  to  the  construction  industry.  Moreover,  the \\nconstruction industry is now recognizing the importance of sustainable building practices and \\nthe urge to reduce environmental impacts.  \\n\\nDesigning out waste and keeping products and materials in use at the highest possible value \\nare  the  core  principles  of  a  circular  economy  (Ellen  Macarthur  Foundation,  2022).  By \\nrecovering  products,  components  and  materials,  the  circular  economy  aims  to  preserve \\nresources’  functionality  and  value.  Most  value  is  preserved  when  the  product  or  material \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nremains close to its original state; preserving its integrity (Bakker et al., 2020). Thus, it seems \\na particularly important opportunity to use waste materials in the construction industry by reuse \\nof structurally useful parts (reusing) or the use of raw materials as components to produce new \\nstructural elements (recycling) (Assefa & Ambler, 2017). \\n\\nRecycling is the common approach to treating products after their use. Yet, recycling requires \\nenergy to process materials (e.g. material extraction, transportation, manufacturing etc.) and \\noften results in a loss of quality (e.g. crushed concrete for road construction). An often more \\nsustainable option is reuse, which implies only minimal physical transformations and the use \\nof already embedded technology (Brütting, de Wolf, et al., 2019) (Figure 6). In short: the reuse \\nof building structures must become mainstream and given the need for circularity, it will be \\nunavoidable that in the future the balance will tip much more in the direction of reuse of the \\nbuilding structure and transformation of the building, instead of demolition and recycling (Blok \\n& Teuffel, 2019). \\n\\nFigure 6. Circular concept of design for and from reuse at building or component scale (de Wolf et al., 2020) \\n\\nSimilarly, the reuse of end-of-life buildings can produce many positive environmental impacts. \\nIt  can  reduce  the  burden  of  the  landfills  (Kibert  et  al.,  2001)  and  can  bring  energy  savings \\nduring the end-of-life phase if appropriate waste management strategies are implemented for \\ntreating waste materials. In addition, deconstruction was considered more cost-effective than \\nconventional demolition when the costs of landfill disposal and revenues from reused materials \\nwere included into consideration (W. Gao et al., 2000). \\n\\n9 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nState-of-the-art  papers  indicate  that  reusing  structural  elements  is  beneficial  from  an \\nenvironmental  impact  perspective.  (Assefa  &  Ambler,  2017)  investigates  and  compares  the \\npotential life cycle environmental impacts of building repurposing through reuse of structure \\nand  demolition  scenarios  followed  by  new  construction.  The  research  output  indicates  that \\nrepurposing through reuse scenarios showed a potential 20 – 41% reduction in six of the seven \\nenvironmental  impact  categories  assessed.  The  highest  reduction  is  achieved  for  the \\nEutrophication Potential followed by Smog Potential at 37% reduction. Human Health Criteria \\nis the impact category with the least reduction at 20% followed by Acidification Potential at \\n29%. Global Warming Potential and Fossil Fuel Consumption, which are closely correlated, \\nshow  an  avoided  impact  of  33  and  34%  respectively,  because  of  the  decision  to  go  for \\nrepurposing  after  selective  deconstruction  rather  than  complete  demolition  and  new \\nconstruction.  The  exception  is  ozone  layer  depletion  which  hardly  shows  a  difference. \\nMoreover, the benefits  of repurposing  compared to  new construction  demolition  go beyond \\navoiding environmental impacts. \\n\\nOn the other hand, structural element reuse involves element sourcing and extra process for \\ndeconstruction,  reconditioning  (e.g.  cleaning  and  sandblasting  elements)  and  transport.  As \\nthese processes also generate environmental impacts, reuse might not always be preferred over \\nnew  construction  (Brütting  et  al.,  2020).  Furthermore,  according  to  (Baker  et  al.,  2017), \\ndemolition can sometimes be favourable for poor building conditions and buildings that do not \\nmeet the current regulations. Reusing old buildings that were designed and constructed either \\nwhen the seismic codes were not advanced or not enforced by law, lack of recorded information \\nand other factors can also increase the financial risk and overall cost of the project (Rakhshan \\net al., 2021b). \\n\\n2.2.   Design of structures using reused elements \\n\\nTo reduce substantially material consumption and waste caused by the construction industry, \\nstructures  can  be  designed  and  built  with  reused  elements.  That  said,  reusing  load-bearing \\nstructures  is  more  beneficial  given  the  important  share  of  building  environmental  impacts \\nembodied  in  these  elements  and  as  well,  their  large  material  mass  and  energy-intensive \\nfabrication process. Recent endeavours including (Brütting, de Wolf, et al., 2019) developed a \\ntool  that  facilitates  the  application  of  reused  elements  while  minimising  the  environmental \\nimpacts. Moreover, (Brütting, Desruelle, et al., 2019) presents a design optimization technique \\nto design truss structures using reused elements. Furthermore, the life cycle assessment of the \\ncase studies used in the paper indicates that there is up to 63% environmental impact reduction \\nwhen  comparing  structures  obtained  with  the  proposed  method  against  weight-optimized \\nsolutions made of new elements. \\n\\nThe practical  application of the  design  optimization technique with  reuse  elements  has also \\npaved the way for developing the Grasshopper plug-in called Phoenix3D (J. Warmuth et al., \\n2021). Phoenix3D is an open-source Rhino3D and Grasshopper tool to design optimum truss \\nstructures  made  of  new  and  reused  components.  It  aims  to  support  a  more  circular  design \\napproach in the structural design process. For example, (Brütting, Desruelle, et al., 2019) used \\n\\n10 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nthis tool to optimize a steel truss roof structure using elements that are collected from electric \\npylons (Figure 7).  \\n\\nThe pylons shown in (Figure 7) were built in the 1950s in the region of Wallis, Switzerland. \\nSix power transmission lines consisting of such pylons were scheduled to be replaced by one \\nhigh voltage line. However, the pylon members have not yet reached their service life for which \\nthey had been designed. Thus, the pylons were disassembled piece by piece, and the authors \\nquantified  the  number  of  elements  with  one  transmission  line,  as  well  as  their  mechanical \\nproperties,  cross-sectional  area,  connection  details  and  lengths.  Consequently,  the  authors \\nemployed Phoenix3D to optimize the structural design of the roof system of a new train station \\nin Lausanne, Switzerland.  \\n\\nFigure 7. Steel truss roof structure designed using reused elements from electric pylons (Brütting, Desruelle, et al., 2019) \\n\\nDespite the significant environmental impact reduction of designing with reused elements and \\nthe potential to avoid superfluous waste and sourcing new materials, designing a structure from \\na stock of reclaimed elements entails a change of design paradigm: in contrast to conventional \\ndesign practice, the structural geometry and topology depends on element stock characteristics, \\ne.g. material, available cross-sections and lengths. As a result, depending on the element stock, \\ndesigning,  and  building  a  structure  made  only  of  reused  elements  might  not  be  feasible \\n(Brütting, Desruelle, et al., 2019). For example, there might not be enough elements of a certain \\nlength and cross-section available that fit within a required layout. In other cases, structures \\n\\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nmade  from  reused  elements  might  be  oversized  with  respect  to  structures  made  of  newly \\nproduced elements. \\n\\n2.3.    Barriers in reusing structural elements \\n\\nAlthough efforts have been made to increase the reuse rates of building structural elements in \\nrecent years, there are yet no signs of improvements. Contrarily, the reuse rates in the building \\nsector have declined in the last two decades in countries like the UK, and only a fraction of \\nload-bearing building components are reused (Densley Tingley et al., 2017). \\n\\nThe major barriers related to the recent decline of reuse are the knowledge gap in the literature \\non how to identify reusable structural elements and the lack of initiatives to adopt advanced \\ntechnologies that facilitate reuse (Sansom & Avery, 2014). Studies show that the reuse practice \\nis well-suited to the circular economy framework and helps to achieve the sustainability goals \\nthrough  significant  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  from  manufacturing  new  components. \\nFurthermore, the risk and uncertainties associated with reusing structural elements from end-\\nof-life building stocks can be alleviated through the adoption of advanced digital technologies \\n(Çetin et al., 2021). However, the level of digitalization in the industry is now a bottleneck as \\nthe construction industry is the least digitalized sector among others (McKinsey & Company, \\n2016). \\n\\nAnother  significant  factor  affecting  the  reuse  of  building  structural  components  is  design-\\nrelated issues such as matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered \\nelement  (Rakhshan  et  al.,  2021b).  Moreover,  the  presence  of  hazardous,  banned,  or \\ncontaminating  coatings  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  projects  with  reuse.  Therefore, \\nresearch should be conducted to explore these factors and devise solutions to overcome this \\nbarrier. \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  reuse  practice  is  taking  a  slow  pace  as  designers,  contractors  and \\nproperty owners do not have enough information and rules for planning and executing reuse \\nprojects. This is also exasperated by a lack of legislation, standards, and widespread awareness \\n(Hradil,  2014).  Therefore,  more  specialized  seminars  and  courses  should  be  given  to  the \\nengineering  community  professionals.  Not  only  that,  the  proper  usage  of  media  outlets \\n(internet, journals, and documentaries) can also contribute to widespread the benefit of reuse \\nand help realize more reuse projects.  \\n\\nCost is an additional factor that can be taken as  a barrier to reuse. The higher cost of reuse \\noriginates  from  the  quality  checks,  manual  work  during  deconstruction,  storage,  and  long \\ntransport distances. That said, Hradil et al. (2017) believe that reuse can be more competitive \\nwith a further reduction of life cycle costs, by adopting cost-effective deconstruction, sorting, \\nand  inspection  technologies  that  can  significantly  improve  the  economic  benefit  of  reuse \\nscenarios.  \\n\\nIn  general,  the  reuse  practice  may  be  less  common  due  to  problems  related  to  traceability, \\nquality  certification,  availability,  and  lack  of  expertise.  However,  in  near  future,  these \\nchallenges  can  be  overcome  with  non-destructive  testing,  remote  and  drone  surveys,  better \\nsupply chain integration, provision of regulation as well as fiscal incentives. Furthermore, with \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nthe  advent  of  digital  technologies  that  facilitates  digital  transformation,  design  for \\ndeconstruction and reuse, and standardization, the reuse practice has a bright future. However, \\nthe continuous decline in reusing the structural elements of buildings shows the need to develop \\nrobust interdisciplinary reusability evaluation tools to improve the reuse rates. \\n\\n2.4.    Practical examples of reusing structural elements \\n\\nThe environmental impacts of reuse have already been evaluated by academic studies and it \\nwas  reflected  in  selected  number  of  case  studies,  mainly  from  Europe.  That  said,  two  case \\nstudies are selected to demonstrate the practical application of reuse and the lessons learned \\nfrom these projects. The first one is the K 118 Winterthur project from Switzerland, and the \\nsecond from the large-scale EU-funded research project on the provision for greater reuse of \\nsteel structures (PROGRESS, 2020).  \\n\\nCase study 1: K 118 Winterthur \\n\\nThe structure of Hall 118 in (Figure 8) aimed to add three stories to an existing warehouse at \\nthe  Winterthur  storage  area,  using  only  existing  components  from  demolitions.  This  pilot \\nproject mainly indicates that the planning process revolves around the available components. \\nIt begins with the collection of materials and the design changes constantly with the ongoing \\nsearch for different  components. The selection of the component is  followed by measuring, \\ninventorying,  and  cataloguing  to  get  the  most  precise  information  and  precise  idea  of  the \\nrequirements and installation process, before checking and finalizing the final draft. As a result, \\nthe design of the structure was constantly weighted up, based on the input materials that are \\nready for reuse.  \\n\\nFigure 8. The final design of Structural Hall K 118 (Baubüro in situ, 2021) \\n\\nThe main structure is made up of steel girders that once supported the Coop distribution centre \\non the Lysbüchel site in Basel, as shown in Figure 9 (a). Additionally, the four new floors are \\n\\n13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0caccessible via an external steel staircase from the former Orion office building in Zurich. The \\nstair landings indicate the floor heights as it is shown in Figure 9 (b). \\n\\nState of the art \\n\\nFigure 9. (a) Internal steel girder (b) External steel staircase (Baubüro in situ, 2021) \\n\\nIn conclusion, for this K 118 project, it was possible to reduce the energy and emissions in the \\nlife  of  the  building.  Quantitatively,  60%  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  500  tons  of \\nprimary materials can be saved compared to new components (Baubüro in situ, 2021). \\n\\nCase study 2: New Building with Old Structures  \\n\\nThe single-storey hall was part of an old fabrication plant located in Wuppertal, Germany. Due \\nto growth over the years, this site was planned to be demolished and to be replaced by modern \\nfabrication  buildings  afterwards.  In  total  there  existed  2  halls  as  well  as  an  office  building. \\nWhile  the  office  building  and  the  greater  part  of  the  fabrication  halls  from  the  1950s  were \\nplanned to be demolished, the oldest hall was planned to be kept for historical reasons. Because \\nthe  fabrication  started  once  in  this  hall,  there  was  a  deep  interest,  to  keep  as  least  the  roof \\nstructure to integrate this as a remembrance of the beginning of the company. \\n\\nThe  demolition  project  is  mainly  composed  of  the  demolition  of  the  1950s  hall,  the \\ndeconstruction and saving of the roof structure from the 1920s hall and the demolition of the \\noffice building, as it is presented in (Figure 10).  \\n\\nFigure 10. Deconstruction plan before the new building (PROGRESS, 2020) \\n\\nThe construction of the roof structure consists of steel timbering. Up on the bearing structure, \\nthe roof was built of wood with a regular sealing of old tar-based cardboard. Due to the filigree \\nsteal-structure,  preliminary  cardboard  and  wood  were  deconstructed  by  manpower. \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n\\x0cAfterwards, all joints of the girders to columns were dismantled and only the horizontal links \\nare retained for stability reasons (Figure 11). \\n\\nState of the art \\n\\nFigure 11. disassembled steel girder (PROGRESS, 2020) \\n\\nThis project indicates that dismantling structures for reuse is quite different from the regular \\ndemolition process. For regular demolition, there is no need to keep anything intact and the \\nboundary conditions are the safety of neighbouring buildings and focus on raw materials. The \\ndeconstruction, however, focuses on the construction itself to be kept intact. Thus, there is an \\nincrease in handmade work instead of the use of excavators. Furthermore, both demolition and \\ndeconstruction lead to the same rates of steel reuse from materials point of view. However, if \\nthe costs are considered, the costs of deconstruction for reuse are much higher and the cost can \\nbe reverted through savings on purchasing the same new elements. \\n\\n2.5.   Reuse in other disciplines \\n\\nRecycling is eventually necessary to prevent the loss of materials but is also the least preferred \\nloop for selected industries, as the effort invested in manufacturing is lost. This is especially \\nrelevant for composite materials, which derive their high-quality mechanical properties from a \\nspecific combination of materials, manufacturing process, and design (Joustra et al., 2021a). \\nThis process, as a result, presents a challenging case for material recovery in other industries, \\nespecially for the Aerospace and Automotive industries. \\n\\nGiven the complicated process of reuse of the large size, complex shape, and complex material \\ncomposition  of composite products,  Joustra et  al.  (2021b) proposed a systematic method to \\ndefine segmentation patterns and evaluate structural quality. As a result, the author proposed \\nan  approach  for  the  structural  reuse  of  complex  composite  products  through  segmentation, \\nstructural  analysis,  and reuse applications.  Thus,  the approach was tested  on  a typical  wind \\nturbine blade made of glass and carbon fibre composite. The segmentation pattern showed that \\nhigh accuracy construction elements can be cut from a double-curved product, in such a way \\nthat 95% of the analysed blade section and 55% of the complete blade are eligible for reuse. \\nMoreover, the structural analysis revealed good performance in terms of flexural stiffness and \\nflexural strength in relation to weight, with the retrieved panels exceeding the performance of \\nconventional construction materials for constructions loaded in bending.  The reuse of blade \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\npanels  in  another  product  showed  the  need  for  specialised  cutting  equipment  and  delivered \\naccurately dimensioned parts. \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  recently,  there  has  been  a  tremendous  uptick  in  worldwide  research  on \\nreusing  high-performance  fibres,  particularly  aerospace-grade  carbon  fibre  from  end-of-life \\ncured thermoset composites. Fibre reclamation remains the focus of such composite recycling \\nefforts. It is apparent that recycling the composites has a strong foothold and is commercially \\nprofitable across several industries, such as aerospace (high volume, low production rate, long \\nservice  life)  and  automotive  (high  volume;  high  production  rate;  medium  service  life) \\n(Nilakantan  &  Nutt,  2015).  However,  it  is  not  feasible  to  reuse  scrap  aerospace  prepreg  in \\nprimary or critical aerospace structures, as they will not meet the performance requirements or \\npass  certification.  Their  incorporation  in  secondary  or  tertiary  aerospace  structures  is  yet \\nunclear  given  the  potential  lack  of  consistency  in  the  feedstock  material.  Consequently, \\nNilakantan & Nutt (2015) suggested producing potentially hundreds of end-products that can \\nbe  built  partially  or  entirely  from  scrap  thermoset  prepreg.  Examples  are  medical  devices, \\nsporting  and  recreation  goods,  automotive  and  aerospace  structures,  construction,  furniture, \\nand shipping containers. \\n\\nReuse efforts  in  the above-mentioned industries  are particularly  appealing because both  the \\ncarbon fibre and resin within the scrap prepreg are usable, high-value components and do not \\nrequire destructive separation. Moreover, carbon fibre composites are not just used for their \\nlightweight properties and superior structural performance but also coveted for their distinctive \\nvisual appeal and therefore find dozens of aesthetic-based applications such as armrests, cell \\nphone  cases,  and  cup  holders  which  are  non-structural,  and  customized  home  and  office \\nfurniture which is structural in nature. \\n\\n2.6. Decision-making criteria tools for reuse in the built environment  \\n\\nCriteria used to assess the adaptation potential of existing buildings have been researched by a \\nrange of academics. For example, Kutut et al. (2014) used an analytical hierarchy process and \\npairwise comparison to weight criteria, including whether the building requires investment or \\nnot,  its heritage value and the state of the building.  Other academics have expanded on the \\nprovision of the criteria and created tools that aid decision-makers (Baker et al., 2017). \\n\\nThe transformation meter and the IconCUR have been designed for asset managers to assess \\nbuildings for the appropriate form of intervention. The transformation meter (Rob Geraedts & \\nTheo  J  M  Van  der  Voordt,  2007)  was  designed  in  the  Netherlands  for  rapid  adaptation \\nassessment of residential buildings. The tool comprises five stages each of which requires a \\nbinary yes/no answer. The main stages are the quick scan, the overall feasibility of adaptation \\nusing  a  combination  of  building  and  location  criteria,  transformation  class  identification, \\nfinancial  feasibility,  and  risk  identification.  For  each  stage,  different  criteria  are  set  to \\ndetermine if each stage under consideration is met or not.  \\n\\nLangston & Smith (2012) have created a three-dimensional (3D) spatial tool, called IconCUR \\nthat uses multiple criteria to assess the performance of an asset during its life cycle in the early \\nstage  of  decision-making  and  has  been  ‘integrated  into  commercial  asset  management \\n\\n16 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nsoftware. This tool, in addition to the adaptation potential of the building, identifies the possible \\nalternatives \\nto  adaptation  such  as  renovate/preserve,  retain/extend,  reuse/adapt  or \\nreconstruct/dispose, depending on a range of weighted criteria. \\n\\nSimilarly,  Hradil  et  al.  (2017)  introduced  a  new  method  for  the  reusability  assessment  of \\ncomponents and structures of steel-framed buildings. It evaluates the reuse potential of end-of-\\nlife  steel  frames  based  on  eight  categories  i.e.,  deconstruction  and  disassembly,  handling \\nmanipulation,  separation  cleaning,  redesigning,  adopting  for  another  purpose,  modification, \\nand  quality  check.  Furthermore,  the  method  is  applied  to  an  existing  typical  industrial  hall \\nstructure  to  evaluate  the  reusability  factor  of  the  building  and  compute  the  environmental \\nimpact  of  reuse  for  a  second  life.  The  result  shows  that  approximately  60%  of  the  steel \\nstructural  elements  are  suited  for  reuse  and  up  to  70%  of  the  environmental  impact  can  be \\nreduced if only the rafters of the structure are reused 1.46 times on average in comparison to \\nthe scenario without reuse.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, although the existing state of the art regarding the current state of steel reuse \\nis broad-ranging, (Yeung et al., 2015) identified that several supply chain models have been \\npresented in the field of steel reuse, but these models do not incorporate engineering decision \\nmaking processes. As a result, the authors proposed a decision-making framework that refers \\nto decisions around the feasibility of effectively reusing structural steel for reuse, as it is shown \\nin (Figure 12) and (Figure 13). \\n\\nFigure 12. Decision making integrated into the steel reuse process model (Yeung et al., 2015) \\n\\n17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nFigure 13. Generalized decision-making procedure for steel reuse (Yeung et al., 2015) \\n\\n2.7.   Image classification and damage identification in Civil Engineering \\n\\nImage data has the potential of assisting Engineers and decision-makers in a variety of safety \\ninspection and monitoring tasks by supplementing the initial on-site assessment. Image data \\ncan be acquired easily and quickly using digital cameras, or potentially using more advanced \\nsystems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and/or satellite imagery. Besides, image \\ndata  could  capture  the  visual  information  of  structurally  deficient  buildings,  for  instance, \\nbuildings evaluated during the post-earthquake visual inspection by human inspectors (Torok \\net al., 2014). Therefore, by establishing and implementing appropriate steps of data processing, \\nimage data is expected to provide initial knowledge of the current state of the structures without \\ninteraction with human experts. \\n\\nPictures collected properly can be used to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of a damaged \\nstructure (Jahanshahi & Masri, 2012). It may be safe for people to walk around and take these \\nimages from the exterior of buildings; however, examining interior supporting elements such \\nas columns and beams would require entering a compromised building and potentially put a \\nresponder’s life at  risk.  To address  these challenges, automated small  mobile robots can be \\nused in that the operator would remain safely outside the building structures whereas the robot, \\nequipped  with  a  digital  camera  and  wireless  controls,  enters  the  building  to  gather  images \\nneeded to reconstruct a 3D model of the indoor building environment. Once a 3D model point \\ncloud model is reconstructed, the outcome will be assessed using a new algorithm to identify \\nand locate different damage types. Moreover, in most cases, the resulting models enable the \\ngeometrical characteristics of the damages to be quickly and easily measured and ultimately \\nlead to an accurate assessment of all building elements. \\n\\nA variety of techniques have been applied to detect damages automatically from a close-up \\nimage of a structural component (Y. Gao & Mosalam, 2020) (Han et al., 2022). However, the \\napplication of automatic damage detection methods becomes increasingly difficult when the \\nimage includes multiple components from different structures. To reduce the inaccurate false \\n\\n18 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\npositive  alarms,  critical  structural  components  need  to  be  recognized  first,  and  the  damage \\nalarms need to be cleaned using the component recognition results (Narazaki et al., 2018). \\n\\n2.8. Artificial Intelligence and the applications in Civil Engineering \\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset of computing tools have been widely used and proved \\nan efficient way of solving complex problems in civil engineering applications specifically to \\nsupport  decision-making  processes  in  an  efficient,  economic,  and  time-saving  manner \\n(Harirchian et al., 2021).  \\n\\nAI is a broad field that includes machine learning and deep learning algorithms (Figure 14). \\nThe subsequent chapters focus on the role of intelligent AI algorithms whose distinctive feature \\nis the ability to learn by themselves. In this context, the sub-branch of AI algorithms that are \\nrelevant to this research and their application in the civil engineering domain is discussed as \\nfollows. \\n\\nFigure 14. Artificial intelligence and its subset computing tools (Alzubaidi et al., 2021) \\n\\n2.8.1.  Machine Learning \\n\\nMachine Learning (ML) is one of the AI tools, a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and \\nbuilding methods that ‘learn’, that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on \\nsome set of tasks. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as \\ntraining data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed \\nto do so (Wikipedia contributors, 2022).  \\n\\nML  techniques  have  been  widely  used  in  several  civil  engineering  applications  given  their \\nefficiency in solving complex problems. With the rapid increase of data availability, increasing \\n\\n19 \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\ncomputational  resources  and  simplified  programming  methods,  machine  learning  tools  are \\nbeing broadly applied for innovative applications in various fields of civil engineering. This \\nincludes developing structural response prediction models (Mangalathu et al., 2020) (Roeslin \\net al., 2020), structural health monitoring (Bao et al., 2019), optimization problems (Greco & \\nUk London, 2018), damage detection (Avci et al., 2021), and investigating the behaviour of \\ndifferent civil systems (Vadyala et al., 2022). \\n\\nStudies show the substantial potential of the machine learning techniques in determining the \\nreusability  of  the  load-bearing  building  components.  The  study  (Rakhshan  et  al.,  2021b) \\ndeveloped a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques that \\npredict  the  reuse  potential  of  structural  elements  at  the  end-of-life  of  a  building.  For  this \\npurpose, the authors identified and ranked the main reusability factors based on the experience \\nof  the  reuse  stakeholders  in  the  building  sector.  Secondly,  they  developed  an  easy-to-\\nunderstand  learner  that  can  be  used  by  practitioners  to  have  an  initial  assessment  of  the \\ntechnical reusability of the load-bearing components. \\n\\n2.8.2.  Convolutional Neural Network \\n\\nThe convolutional  neural  network (CNN) is  a deep learning  (DL) network architecture that \\nlearns directly from data, without the need for manual feature extraction (Lecun et al., 1998). \\nA typical  CNN architecture  consists of  an input  layer,  convolutional layers, pooling layers, \\nfully connected layers, and output layers, as is shown in (Figure 15). The CNN architecture \\nimproves the typical artificial neural network (ANN), which is also considered as regularized \\nversions of multi-layer perceptron.  \\n\\nFigure 15. General architecture of CNNs (Dive into deep learning, 2020) \\n\\nThe main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the \\nimportant features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats \\nand  dogs  it  learns  distinctive  features  for  each  class  by  itself.  Furthermore,  CNN  is  also \\ncomputationally efficient as it uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs \\nparameter sharing (Dertat, 2017). After convolution and pooling layers, the final pooling layer \\nis  flattened to a  one dimensional  (1D) vector that becomes the input for the fully connected \\nANN layers. \\n\\n20 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\nThe  convolution  layers  are  the  main  powerhouse  of  a  CNN  model.  Automatically  detecting \\nmeaningful features given only an image and a label is not an easy task. The convolution layers \\nlearn such complex features by building on top of each other. The first layers for instance detect \\nedges, the next layers combine them to detect shapes, to following layers merge this information \\nto infer some features from a lot of training images. The fully connected layers thus learn how \\nto use these features produced by convolutions in order to correctly classify the images. \\n\\nAccuracy of CNN or DL algorithms in general is influenced by the quality of the dataset used \\nfor the training and testing of the model. Therefore, an optimal solution is achieved when the \\ndata  is  abundant,  as  the  model  can  be  validated  and  tested  on  new  dataset.  Calibration  and \\nvalidation are also possible with separate databases (Falcone et al., 2020). Moreover, DL based \\nclassification  technique  performs  more  accurately  with  pre-processed  data  while  non-\\nprocessed data is less accurate, but it takes less time to process. \\n\\nCNNs has been widely used in different civil engineering subdomain by many researchers. For \\nexample,  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  used  densely  connected  CNNs  to  study  vibrational  based \\nstructural damage classification. (Narazaki et al., 2018) also employed multiscale CNNs for \\nautomated vision-based bridge component extraction. (Y. Gao & Mosalam, 2020) used deep \\nCNNs to classify large scale structural images into eight benchmark classification tasks. (Davis \\net  al.,  2021)  similarly  used  deep  CNNs  to  classify  construction  waste  materials.  Moreover, \\n(Manjurul  Islam  &  Kim,  2019)  used  fully  conventional  encoder-decoder  networks  for \\nautonomous crack detection of concrete structures. \\n\\n2.9.  AI in decision-making outcome of other disciplines \\n\\nPravin Dhulekar et al. (2018) proposed a Bottle Recycling Machine (BRM) design based on \\nMachine Learning (ML) techniques. The authors preferred to use this approach as it is the most \\nadvanced method than the other approaches such as barcode scanning and image processing. \\nIn the proposed BRM design, the difficulties of bottle identification are solved using ML model \\nthat is trained to identify different kinds of bottes. The output of the algorithm was to identify \\nif a given object is a plastic bottle or not. As a result, they were able to identify bottles which \\nare not even in shape.  \\n\\nSimilarly, several authors have carried out extensive research on garbage sorting and recycling \\nand put useful advanced technologies into practice. Some scholars combined the existing image \\nclassification technology and machine learning models, based on image recognition. (Zhang et \\nal.,  2021)  developed  a  model  with  high-precision  image  classification  of  recyclable  waste \\nsorting through deep learning, with a waste classification model (CTR) based on an 18-layer \\nresidual  network  (ResNet18).  Moreover,  (Adedeji  &  Wang,  2019)  proposed  an  intelligent \\nwaste materials classification system based on 50-layer residual network pre-train CNN model \\nserving as the extractor and support vector machine method as a classifier, to categorize the \\nwaste into different group such as glass, metal, plastic etc. \\n\\n2.10.  Conclusions from the literature study and added value of the thesis \\n\\nThe  state-of-the-art  (SoA)  reviews  academic  literatures  that  individually  focus  on  reuse  of \\nstructural  elements  from  environmental  impact  perspective,  the  application  of  advanced  AI \\n\\n21 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cState of the art \\n\\ntechnologies in civil engineering, decision-making criteria and tools in the built environment, \\nand AI applications in decision-making outcomes of other disciplines. \\n\\nLiteratures  in  the  SoA  all  advocates  the  environmental  benefits  of  reuse  and  repurposing \\nstructural elements. There are also studies that investigate the potential life cycle environmental \\nimpacts of reuse and indicates that reuse scenarios have significant reduction in environmental \\nimpacts. These papers, in most cases, use life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the benefits \\nof reuse with that of new construction. However, less focus is given to the methodologies that \\ncan be used to identify the reusable structural elements. \\n\\nOn the other hand, even though the benefits of reuse and repurposing is highly suggested by \\nthe literatures, the overall practice of reuse rate of structural elements is declining in recent \\nyears due to two main reasons.  \\n\\n•  The absence of the general decision-making framework to identify reusable elements \\n\\nfrom buildings that reaches their end-of-life services. \\n\\n•  The lack of initiatives to adopt advanced technologies that would facilitate the reuse of \\n\\nstructural elements.  \\n\\nReusing  structural  elements  can  have  associated  risks  and  uncertainties,  given  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  that  would  help  decision-makers  to  decide  reliably  whether  a  given \\nstructural element is reusable or not. Therefore, the continuous decline in reusing the structural \\nelements of buildings shows the need to develop robust interdisciplinary reusability evaluation \\ntools to improve the reuse rates. \\n\\nThe advent of advanced AI techniques has proved an incredible efficiency for problem-solving \\nin a variety of civil engineering applications including but not limited to, structural element \\nidentification and damage detection. These tools are also proved to support decision-making \\nprocesses in an efficient, economic, and time-saving manner. However, the SoA review has \\nnot unearthed any application of deep CNNs in the field of reuse. \\n\\nDue to these problems, this thesis aims to: \\n\\n•  Develop  a  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  that  helps  stakeholders  in \\nevaluating the potential reusability or repurposing of structural elements from end-of-\\nlife or damaged buildings. \\n\\n•  Develop  an  interdisciplinary  computer-vision  based  reusability  evaluation  tool  that \\nautomates the preliminary structural inspection task from image data using deep CNN. \\nThe tool is expected to classify images based on the corrosion level, connection types \\nand the associated damage that exist on the steel structures. \\n\\n22 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\n3.  METHODOLOGY  \\n\\nThe  general  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  is  developed  by  first  defining  the \\nimportant parameters that affect the reuse potential of structural elements. The parameters are \\nextracted considering the preliminary visual inspection of existing end-of-life buildings and the \\ndetailed technical analysis that incorporate structural and environmental impact assessments. \\nTo that end, the combination of these parameters and their importance in the decision-making \\nprocess is presented in the first phase. Secondly, part of the preliminary visual inspection is \\nautomated  with  deep  CNN  based  tool,  following  the  standard  data  science  methodologies, \\nstarting from data preparation to validation of the CNN model outputs.  \\n\\nAs the scope of this framework, the reuse potential of structural elements is evaluated from \\nmultiple variables i.e., visual inspection of the components, the impact of the connection types \\nfor disassembly technique, the availability of the earlier deign documents, the potential of the \\nelement  for  new  deployment  (same  purpose  or  repurposing),  the  need  for  quality  and \\ndimensional check etc. However, each individual variables cannot decide the overall decision \\non  the  reuse  potential  of  the  structural  element.  Therefore,  the  interdependencies  of  these \\nparameters is also considered.  \\n\\nThe general decision-making framework that incorporates the automated CNN based image \\nclassification  tool  is  shown  in  (Figure  16).  The  framework  assesses  the  reuse  potential  of \\nstructural elements from five main criteria perspective. These criteria are logistic feasibility, \\nstructural  visual  inspection,  structural  performance,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and \\neconomic analysis. Each criterion is inherently composed of parameters that could be assessed \\nduring the preliminary visual inspection and /or detailed technical analysis of the project, as it \\nis going to be discussed in the subsequent sub-chapters. \\n\\nPart of the structural visual inspection criteria, as it is already mentioned, is automated with \\nCNN tools that recognizes the corrosion level, the connection types, and the associated damage \\nfrom steel structure images. Once the performance of these CNN tools is assessed and proved \\nreliable, they are incorporated into the general decision-making framework. Moreover, to better \\nvisualize the framework and facilitate user interaction, an easy-to-understand, low-cost web \\nbased user interface is developed.  \\n\\nThe outcome of this general decision-making framework is to suggest the efficient and feasible \\nend-of-life scenario for the existing building under consideration. These decisions are mainly \\neither to  demolition  and recycle (demolition  – recycle) or dismantle and  reuse (dismantle  – \\nreuse).  Furthermore,  the  user  is  provided  with  the  tool  to  perform  a  simplified  life  cycle \\nassessment for different reuse alternatives.  \\n\\nIn  this  thesis,  the  general  decision-making  framework  and  the  CNN  tools  are  primarily \\ndeveloped  to  steel  structures.  However,  the  methodology  that  is  developed  to  build  the \\nframework  can  be  extended  to  evaluate  the  reusability  analysis  of  any  other  structures  in \\ngeneral. \\n\\n23 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\nEnd-of-life buildings  \\n\\nLogistics feasibility \\n\\n▪  Weight of structural element? \\n▪  Ease  to  handle,  transport,  store,  and  process  the \\n\\nPass \\n\\nstructural element? \\n\\n▪  Availability of dismantle-sort-replace infrastructure? \\n▪  Special protection for transportation of the element? \\n▪  Dismantle phase is compatible with demolition work? \\n▪  Availability of storage? \\n\\nDeconstruction \\n\\nStructural visual inspection  \\n\\nNot pass \\n\\nDemolition \\n\\nNot pass \\n\\nCNN tool \\n\\nIs the element corroded? \\nIs the element damaged or distorted? \\n\\n▪  Connection type? \\n▪ \\n▪ \\n▪  Are there steel-concrete composite connections? \\n▪ \\nIs there fire protection on the element? \\n▪ \\nIs there sufficient amount of potential reusable elements? \\n▪  Does the element pass standard geometric check without \\n\\nmodification? \\n\\nPass \\n\\nStructural performance \\n\\n▪  Quality of available data? \\n▪ \\n\\nIs  the  building  designed  and  constructed  after \\n2005? \\n\\n▪  Did the structure have maintenance before? \\n▪ \\n▪ \\n\\nIs the element unique for its structural purpose? \\nIs it possible to conduct sample testing? \\n\\n▪  Non-destructive testing \\n▪ \\n\\nSample testing \\n\\nEnvironmental impact assessment \\n\\nEconomic environmental mode \\n\\n▪ \\n\\nIs it feasible to reuse the element than \\nmanufacturing new element? \\n\\n▪ \\n\\nIs it economically feasible to perform reuse \\nthan buying newly manufactured element? \\n\\nRecycle \\n\\nDECISION \\n\\nReuse \\n\\nFigure 16.

Visual inspection \\n\\nAt the end-of-life of building’s service, the first decision and the most important one to make \\nearly  is  whether  a  deconstruction  is  an  option  or  not.  Deconstruction  infers  a  careful \\ndisassembly of elements in a way that avoids significant damage. This process may apply to \\nthe entire structure, larger assemblies of components, or individual structural members. \\n\\nThis preliminary analysis mainly involves visual inspection by reuse expert or a person with \\ndeep understanding of structural steel design and field experience. The main parameters that \\ngovern the reuse potential of the structural steel elements in this stage are the condition of the \\nelements, and the disassembly. Moreover, rough estimation is expected on remaining capacity \\nof the structural steel and other several factors which are discussed in the following section. \\nFor this, the structural elements, specifically steel in this case, should be exposed from any \\ncoating, cladding, fireproofing, and/or finishing materials. \\n\\nThe visual inspection can provide information if the structural element is in a good condition \\nor not, if it requires an intense cleaning or refitting or if there is any pre-existing damage. Reuse \\nexperts and experienced steel construction professionals can make this assessment. Materials \\nthat are clearly in bad condition (e.g.: damaged during the first implementation) or at the end-\\nof-their  life  are  not  suitable  for  reuse  (Figure  17).  Materials  severely  altered  by  adverse \\nconditions  such  as  leaking,  weathering,  fatigue,  fire,  cracks,  structural  failures  (risk  of \\nbreaking/collapse, etc.) or improper implementation or dismantling operations, should not be \\nreused.  \\n\\nFigure 17. Corroded and damaged steel structure elements (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\nDisassembly  refers to  how easy it is  to  extract  the structural  element from  the entire set of \\nstructural components or frames. It  also considers if the element can be dismantled without \\naltering  its  mechanical  performance  and  aesthetic  aspect.  Furthermore,  it  evaluates  if  the \\ndismantling  process  is  even  technically  feasible,  safe,  and  easily  accessible.  For  instance, \\nbolted  steel  connections  are  easily  dismantlable,  while  welded  connections  can  be  a  labour \\nintensive and costly process.  \\n\\nSome assemblages are almost impossible to dismantle properly. Some construction elements \\ncan be unsuitable or complicated to dismantle and reuse. It is thus essential to remain alert and \\nexercise caution while investigating materials and elements from disassembly perspective. \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\n3.2. Visual inspection from image data \\n\\nOne possible approach for reducing the high identification and visual analysis cost of existing \\nstructures  for  reuse  is  automating  part  of  the  analysis.  This  might  begin  with  acquiring  the \\naccurate 2D images of the structure, with its parameters that describe  the condition and the \\ngeometry of the elements. This may include the identification of corrosion level of the steel \\ncomponents, the connection geometry, deviations from the design dimensions, the associated \\ndamage as well as basic information such as the nominal member sizes, in cases where original \\nstructural drawings are not available. \\n\\nThe primary information that can be found from 2D images are the pixel level of the image \\nitself, the component type, the material type, the connection types (of steel structures) and if \\nthere are associated visible damages i.e., corrosion, distortion, cracks etc. That said,  (Figure \\n18) outline the procedures proposed to develop deep CNN models to automate part of the visual \\ninspection of steel structures for reuse. \\n\\nImage data \\n\\nCorroded? \\n\\nCorroded | Not corroded \\n\\nConnection type? \\n\\nWelded | Bolted  \\n\\nDamaged? \\n\\nDamaged | Not damaged \\n\\nDemolition – Recycle  \\n\\nDisassemble – Reuse \\n\\nFigure 18. CNN tools procedure to automate part of the visual inspection of structures \\n\\nFor this thesis, three separate CNN models are proposed to be trained and validated from steel \\nstructure images data. The models primarily classify a given structural element in the image \\nbased on the corrosion level, the connection type, and the damage status. The output of these \\nmodels affects the general decision to some extent. For instance, elements that are corroded, \\ndamaged, and welded are likely to be recycled than reused. However, the final decision cannot \\nbe governed solely by a single parameter. A good example can be a structural element that is \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\nin a good condition but with welded connection. In this case, depending on the length of the \\nelement, further analysis should be made if it is feasible to cut the element from the attached \\ncomponents and reuse it elsewhere. As a result, to consider this factor, an appropriate weight \\nis going to be assigned for the output of the CNN tools, as it is discussed in section 4.2.2 of this \\npaper. \\n\\n3.3. Detailed technical analysis \\n\\nOne of the main barriers in the real application of reuse in new building design is the lack of \\ninformation  on  the  technical  performance  of  the  reused  element.  Structural  designers  more \\noften find it difficult to trust and reuse elements, as it is difficult to know what the element has \\nbeen  through,  the  ownership  it  had  and  previous  usage  of  the  elements  in  their  service  life \\nbefore coming to the new construction site. As a result, there is no guarantee to use it as a newly \\nmanufactured element.  \\n\\nCollecting technical information and/or performing detailed technical analysis will help reduce \\nor  possibly  remove  the  uncertainties  regarding  the  performance  of  the  reused  elements  and \\nenable stakeholders and designers to have much confidence in these elements as a new product.  \\n\\nMore  specifically,  technical  analyses  are  mainly  intended  to  check  whether  the  structural \\nelements  that  have  passed  the  preliminary  visual  inspection  are  structurally  sound, \\nenvironmentally  friendly,  and  economically  feasible  to  reuse.  The  preliminary  visual \\ninspection  is  now  augmented  with  simplified  but  reliable  structural,  environmental,  and \\neconomic analysis, in a way that avoid uncertainties and help stakeholders in deciding to what \\nextent they can reuse the structural element. \\n\\ni.  Structural analysis \\n\\nAdequate information on mechanical and physical property of each reusable elements is vital \\nfor  the  decision-making  process.  Consulting  the  original  drawings  and  specifications,  if \\npossible,  can  eliminate  the  associated  risk  and  making  very  conservative  assumptions \\nconcerning  the  properties.  With  respect  to  steel  structures,  important  properties  include  the \\nyield and ultimate strength. \\n\\nGeometrical characterizations may have a key role in decision process for each case of potential \\nsteel reuse because it helps identify the unknown in-situ sizes and assembly geometries, which \\nwill in turn, reduce the uncertainties when assessing reusability. In this regard, determining the \\nphysical  properties  of  the  structural  element  can  be  of  major  importance  to  estimate  the \\nmechanical  properties  of  the  reused  elements.  Alternatively,  non-destructive  testing  (NTD), \\nVickers harness using portable ultrasonic hardness testers, and rebound-type portable hardness \\nmeters can also be used, to estimate the mechanical properties of the reusable elements (Fujita \\n& Kuki, 2016). \\n\\nii.  Environmental impact assessment \\n\\nIn  addition  to  the  information  related  to  the  structural  performance,  it  is  necessary  to \\nsupplement the reuse evaluation with the possible environmental impact of the reuse material \\nand  the  associated  operations.  This  information  can  certainly  influence  the  reusability  of \\n\\n27 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\nmaterials – even more for projects that aim to demonstrate the effort to lower the environmental \\nimpact  or  projects  targeting  environmental  certifications  e.g.,  High  Environmental  Quality \\n(HQE, 2016), BREEAM (BRE, 2022), LEED (USGBC, 2022). \\n\\nEvaluating the environmental impact assessment of reuse materials is under extensive study \\nand researchers are looking for more robust measurements to demonstrate the benefits of reuse \\npractice. Recently, (de Wolf et al., 2020) compared the exiting methodologies to quantify the \\nglobal  warming  potential  of  reusable  and  recyclable  elements.  The  methods  used  for \\ncomparison were the cut-off method, the end-of-life method, the distributed allocation (PAS-\\n2050) method, the Environmental footprint method, and the Degressive method and the SIA \\n2032 method. As a result, new equations were adopted and applied to buildings with reused \\nmaterials for each model.  \\n\\nThe  commonly  used  approaches  are  using  Life-Cycle-Analysis  (LCA)  methods.  LCA \\ncompares  the  various  environmental  impacts  of  all  phases  of  the  life  of  a  material  using \\ndifferent indicators as global warming, ozone depletion, but also incoming and outgoing flow \\nand waste flow  indicators  (FCRBE, 2020). Alternatively,  a  comparison between a  new and \\nreused  component  can  determine  the  associated  benefit  from  environmental  impact \\nperspective. For instance, the new component is assessed based on the materials and process \\nrequired  to  created  it,  while  the  reused  element  is  assessed  based  on  the  extraction, \\ntransportation, and storage processes. As a result, the output indicates if the reused component \\nis worthy enough than creating new one. \\n\\niii.  Economic analysis \\n\\nReuse  elements  that  pass  the  performance  and  LCA  criteria  should  also  be  assessed  for \\neconomic studies. Among the factors that affect the feasibility of reuse, the available quantity \\nof  the  product,  accessibility  to  the  element,  the  amount  of  element  that  is  usable  after \\ndismantling, workload, logistic costs, re-installation cost, transportation cost, the market value \\nof scrap, reused and new steel  should be  considered.  In addition,  the cost  of transportation, \\nstoring, storing duration are also another contributing factors. There quantities can be estimated \\nand then compare with the cost of a similar reuse product on the market. That said, different \\nevaluation tools can be used as per the expert opinion and choice, as the parameters that define \\nthe economic analysis are highly interrelated to each other (Rakhshan et al., 2021a). \\n\\nOn the other hand, depending on the country in which this reusability analysis is going to be \\nperformed, the governmental economic incentives to reduce environmental impact, if any, may \\nreduce the associated cost. Furthermore, in a global scale, it is also important to consider the \\nindustrial cost associated with increasing structural element reuse. \\n\\n3.4. Outlook \\n\\nThe general decision-making framework proposed in this methodology reflects the important \\nparameters that need to  be considered when the  reuse potential of  any structural  element is \\nevaluated. However, the above-mentioned parameters are not a definite criterion, rather, it can \\nbe taken as a good indication of the factors the experts and stakeholders should consider when \\nassessing the reuse potential of a given structural element. Equally important, certain factors \\n\\n28 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cMethodology \\n\\ncan also outweigh the others depending on the client’s need and requirements. For instance, for \\nsome projects, the environmental impact may be more important that the aesthetic or economic \\nvalue. \\n\\nThe  final  decision  is  going  to  be  made  by  the  stakeholders  as  the  capabilities  and  market \\nposition varies. Ultimately, the aim of this general decision-making framework is to provide \\ninformation on certain contributing factors that should be considered when making reusability \\nanalysis for future use, so that the associated uncertainties and risk shall reduce. \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\n4.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK \\n\\nThe above-mentioned decision-making framework has been implemented into computer code \\nto facilitate user interaction. This would allow the user, be it a reuse expert or junior Engineer, \\nto  input  the  required  information  that  are  necessary  into  the  decision-making  process. \\nMoreover, given the dependency of these parameters uniquely on each intended reuse project, \\nit is important to define appropriate weights for each parameter based on their contribution into \\nthe final decision. \\n\\nImplementation of the general decision making framework mainly composes developing the \\nCNN models and defining the appropriate weights for each parameter in the criteria. The CNN \\ntool  development  is  discussed  in  the  first  phase,  following  the  standard  data  science \\nmethodologies from data collection to validating the output of the models. Next, the weights \\nof  the  parameters  and  criteria  performance  evaluation  are  defined  in  the  second  phase.  In \\nconclusion of the implementation, the developed CNN tool is incorporated to general decision-\\nmaking  framework  and  an  easy-to-understand,  low-cost,  web-based  user  dashboard  is \\ndeveloped. \\n\\n4.1. Develop CNN models \\n\\nIn general, the creation of a typical CNN model involves four main stages (Figure 19). It starts \\nfrom the data preparation, and it is crucial in that it can take longer time than the others. This \\nstage involves the acquisition of data, analysis, pre-processing, and data labelling. The quality \\nand quantity  of data are  determinant  for a good  output and better performance of  the CNN \\nmodel.  \\n\\nData preparation \\n\\n-  Data collection \\n-  Data pre-processing \\n-  Data labelling \\n-  Data augmentation \\n-  Data classification \\n\\nModel selection \\n\\n-  Development \\nframework \\n\\n-  CNN architecture \\n\\nBuild CNN model \\n\\nDeployment \\n\\n-  Model training \\n-  Hyperparameter tuning \\n-  Model testing \\n-  Performance evaluation \\n\\n-  Save model weights \\n-  Plan monitoring and \\n\\nmaintenance \\n\\nFigure 19. General steps of CNN model creation \\n\\nThe second stage is the selection and design of the appropriate CNN model, which is followed \\nby the third stage which is training and output evaluation or validation. It is not uncommon that \\nat the end of this process, the model developer realises that changes are required in the data or \\nthe model architecture,  and the design  should be re-adjusted. Once the model is  considered \\nwell designed, trained, and validated, it is ready to enter its final stage of deployment.  \\n\\nThat  said,  the  following  subchapters  discuss  the  steps  taken  to  develop  the  three  machine \\nlearning models i.e., CNN for corrosion, CNN for connection type, and CNN for damage, that \\ncomprises the decision-making framework from image data.  \\n\\n30 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\n4.1.1.  Data preparation \\n\\n4.1.1.1. Data collection \\n\\nFor a supervised CNN model to perform effectively with a classification task, large number of \\nimages  are  required.  However,  since  the  reuse  of  building  elements  is  not  a  widespread \\npractice, collecting more image data was not trivial. For that, images are primarily collected \\nfrom open-source image datasets, for e.g. Unsplash (Unsplash, 2022) and Pinterest (Pinterest, \\n2022). The total number of images that are used for each CNN models is reported in (Table 1). \\n\\nTable 1. Total number of images used for each CNN models \\n\\nModel \\n\\nCNN for corrosion \\nCNN for connection type \\nCNN for damage \\n\\nTotal number of images \\n537 \\n300 \\n488 \\n\\nIt is worth noting that (Y. Gao & Mosalam, 2020) were able to collect the largest scale image \\ndataset, approximately more than 36,000 images, for the researcher’s community in structural \\nand  seismic  engineering  field  of  study.  However,  most  of  the  images  are  from  reinforced \\nconcrete  structures  and  the  low  resolution  of  the  images  made  it  inconvenient  to  label  the \\nimages for the intended classification task i.e., corrosion, connection types, and damages. \\n\\n4.1.1.2. Data pre-processing \\n\\nData pre-processing refers to manipulation and cleaning out data before it is used for machine \\nlearning projects. It is important step as data collection methods are often loosely controlled \\nand may contain irrelevant, redundant, and noisy or unreliable data. Analysing data that has \\nnot been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. \\n\\nMost  of  the  images  that  are  collected  from  the  open-source  dataset  are  a  combination  of \\nbuilding level and object level images (Figure 20). Object level images refer to images that are \\ntaken more closely and comprises single part of the structural elements i.e., column, beam, or \\nsometimes both. Building level images, on the other hand, are taken from a far distance and \\nmostly comprises the whole structure. Employing a classification task on building level images \\ncan be tricky as the whole structure may comprise different structural components that could \\nbe classified into different class. Furthermore,  building level images can be inconvenient to \\nevaluate the corrosion level, the connection type, and the damage status  of single structural \\nelements/components, as these images are mostly taken from a far distance.  \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  given  the  variety  of  the  size,  degree  of  quality,  pixel  level,  colour  and \\norientation of the images, data pre-processing was required, by first manually eliminating low-\\nresolution  and  noisy  images  and  then  adjusting  the  images  into  the  same  level  of  size  and \\nquality. For the latter, an already embedded PyTorch library (Paszke et al., 2019) is used when \\nloading the dataset, and before feeding into the CNN models. \\n\\n31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nFigure 20. Steel images (Left: building level, right: object level) (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\n4.1.1.3.Data labelling \\n\\nIn machine learning, data labelling is the process of identifying raw data (images, videos, etc.) \\nand adding one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine \\nlearning  model  can  learn  from  it  (Amazon  web  services,  2022).  For  instance,  labels  might \\nindicate whether the structural element in an image is corroded or not corroded. \\n\\nTo reduce task complexity and the time required to manually label the images, an alternative \\nPyTorch ̋ ImageFolder ̏ labelling is used so that each image is classified in one folder per class, \\nin the sense that all images in that folder are of that class. For instance, to label a set of corroded \\nimages, all corroded images are put into a folder named ̋ Corroded ̏ and PyTorch automatically \\nassign the label ̋ Corroded ̏  to each image in that folder. The sample image datasets that are \\nlabelled for the three CNN models are presented in the subsequent set of figures.  \\n\\ni.  CNN for corrosion \\n\\nFigure 21.

That  said,  in  this  thesis,  the  CNN  damage  is  trained \\ncategorizing all steel damage types labelled as  ̋damaged ̏.  \\n\\nFrom the above images, it is clearly seen that some images are suitably used for multiple CNN \\nmodels. A corroded steel section with bolted connection type (Figure 26) can be used for both \\nCNN  corrosion  and  CNN  connection  type  models.  Similarly,  images  that  are  corroded  and \\nbadly damaged (Figure 27) can be used for both CNN corrosion and CNN damage models. \\n\\nFigure 26. Corroded steel element with bolted connection (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\nFigure 27. Corroded and badly damaged steel element (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  some  images  could  cause  confusions  in  both  data  labelling  and  model \\ntraining stage. For instance, (Figure 28) is a good example for the type of images that mislead \\nboth the data annotator and the CNN model. Often in training the models, the corrosion level \\nof steel structure could be confused with the colour of the structure itself. In this case, either \\nusing  more  variety  of  red  coloured  steel  structures  image  or  employing  data  normalization \\ntechnique can help. For this specific thesis, both approaches are employed and discussed in the \\nsubsequent sub-chapters.  \\n\\n35 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nFigure 28. Red coloured steel images that confuse with corroded steel elements (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\nAnother image data that could cause confusion during data annotation/labelling are steel joints \\nthat contains both welded and bolted connections (Figure 29). In this specific connection, the \\nbottom plates are welded to both beam and column sections, and they mainly prevent the beam \\nfrom rotation. Moreover, this type of connection causes difficulty in the disassembly process \\nand ultimately affects the final decision for reuse. Therefore, in this thesis, all connection types \\nthat prevents easy disassembly are treated as ̋ welded ̋.   \\n\\nFigure 29. Steel joints that contain both bolted and welded connections (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022)  \\n\\n4.1.1.4. Data Augmentation \\n\\nThe amount of image dataset that is used to train and test the machine learning model is smaller \\nthan  what  is  usually  required  for  a  typical  model.  This  usually  causes  an  overfitting  in \\nprediction  as  well  as  false-positive  results  due  to  data  imbalance.  Therefore,  different  data \\nscience  techniques  such  as  data  augmentation  and  normalization  should  be  implemented  to \\nhelp reduce these problems.  \\n\\nData augmentation in data analysis and computer vision applications are techniques used to \\nincrease the amount of data variability by adding slightly modified copies of already existing \\ndata or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce \\noverfitting when training a machine learning model.  It  is  closely related  to  oversampling in \\ndata analysis (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019).   \\n\\n36 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nPossible  techniques  to  augment  images  in  deep  learning  are  geometric  transformations, \\nflipping, colour modification, cropping, rotation, noise injection and random  erasing.  These \\ntechniques are relevant especially when the number of training datasets are limited or scarce. \\nIn training the CNN models, a combination of data normalization and data augmentation is \\nimplemented  before  feeding  the  images  into  the  models.  The  techniques  used  are  mainly \\nrandom rotation, random horizontal flip as shown in (Figure 30).   \\n\\nFigure 30. Data augmentation techniques applied on images \\n\\n4.1.1.5. Data classification  \\n\\nThe  available  dataset  is  primarily  classified  as  training,  validation,  and  test  dataset.  The \\nfollowing table indicates the number of the images that are classified for the CNN models. The \\nvalidation  set  is  randomly  selected  from  the  training  dataset  and  the  ratio  of  validation  to \\ntraining is set to be 15%, for all CNN models. \\n\\nTable 2.

Model selection \\n\\nThe accuracy and interpretability of any  machine learning model plays an important role in \\nchoosing the best classification model for the problem at hand. For this thesis, two possible \\napproaches have been considered to train the CNN tool. The first one is a binary classification \\nmodel that utilize object level images and the other approach is to use a building level image \\nand apply semantic segmentation with multi-object labelling. However, the more parameters \\nare used in the image, the more data is necessary for the model to learn and distinguish these \\nparameters. \\n\\nSemantic segmentation is a technique that highlights each element that belongs to specific class \\nor  object  (Figure  31).  This  two-layer  network  identify  the  structural  elements  as  beam  and \\ncolumn first and then classify the object as reusable or not. One possible approach to proceed \\nwith is first to employ the image segmentation and train the model to segment each image data. \\nThen,  the  reuse  classification  can  be  done  on  the  segmented  images  i.e.,  output  of  the  first \\nnetwork. \\n\\nFigure 31. Example of model with semantic segmentation labelling \\n\\nThis  procedure  however  can  be  tricky  and  ambiguous  as  both  classifiers  (objects  and \\nreusability) should be trained separately and the accuracy greatly depends on the performance \\nof  each  model.  Moreover,  the  time  needed  to  label  the  semantic  segmentation  is  huge  and \\ndemanding. Even if the  pixel-to-pixel annotation can also be done using software tools, the \\nlabelling cost is worth considering.  \\n\\n38 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nIn training a machine learning model, the simple the pattern or the concept to be trained, the \\nsmaller is the amount of data required. However, even if the concept is easier to understand in \\nthe real world, different images may represent the concept more differently. For instance, the \\nconcept  of  beam-column  connection  orientation  in  real  world  can  be  mis-represented  as  an \\ninclined structure from distorted image data, as it shown in (Figure 32).  \\n\\nFigure 32. Steel beam-column images with different perspective (Pinterest, 2022; Unsplash, 2022) \\n\\nGiven the above-mentioned reasons, the first approach which is the binary classification CNN \\nmodel with  object  level  images is  implemented for this  thesis.  Furthermore, the  framework \\nwith which the CNN model is scripted, and the model architecture is discussed as follows. \\n\\n4.1.2.1. PyTorch framework for CNN development environment \\n\\nPyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is mainly \\nused  for  applications  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language  processing,  primarily \\ndeveloped by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) (Yegulalp, 2017). \\n\\nThe  targeted  neural  networks  can  be  built  in  pure  Python  or  with  Python\\'s  numerical \\ncomputation package, NumPy. However, these implementations are found to be slow both to \\nwrite and to run. Moreover, in practice, it is typical to build deep learning models with one of \\nseveral machine learning libraries. For this reason, PyTorch will be used for this thesis project. \\n\\nThere  are  many  advantages  using  a  library  like  PyTorch.  First,  many  deep  learning \\nmodels have  certain  operations  in  common. Therefore,  it  is  not  required  to  write  all  the \\nfunctions  when  using  libraries  like  PyTorch.  Importantly  though,  a  key  difference  between \\nthese  libraries  and  the  way  how  they  would  probably  be  implemented  is  that  they  are  also \\nwritten  to  be  computationally efficient  with  the  capability  of utilizing  graphical  processing \\nunits or GPUs.  \\n\\nDeep  learning  models  can  take  a  long  time  to  train, and  a  GPU  implementation  can  be  the \\ndifference between a model training in hours and one that takes days or weeks. Additionally, \\nalmost  all  neural  networks  are  learned  through  backpropagation,  which  requires  taking \\ngradients with respect to the network. These can be derived by hand and indeed, using Python \\nand  NumPy  implementations.  On  the  other  hand,  PyTorch\\'s  Autograd  engine can  do  this \\ndifferentiation automatically, which makes building models much easier (Lorica, 2017).  \\n\\nFinally, machine learning right now has a very large community of researchers, professionals, \\nand  students. PyTorch  has  one  of  the  fastest growing  communities  of  users,  and  it\\'s  very \\n\\n39 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\ncommon to find open-source implementations of state-of-the-art models, step-by-step tutorials \\nwith code examples, and active forums teaming with debugging advice or recent trends.  \\n\\n4.1.2.2. Custom deep CNN model architecture \\n\\nThe  custom  deep  CNN  model  architecture  in  (Figure  33)  is  used  to  develop  the  models. \\nSeparate model is developed to assess the corrosion, connection type and the damage of the \\nsteel element from the images. This model architecture comprises six convolution layers, three \\npooling  layers  and  three-layer  fully  connected  neural  network  (NN)  model  for  binary \\nclassification. The first convolutional layers expect an image of 32 x 32 pixel size, and this can \\nbe facilitated with an embedded PyTorch library. \\n\\nConvolution \\n\\nConvolution \\n\\nPooling + \\nConvolution \\n\\nConvolution \\n\\nPooling + \\nConvolution \\n\\nConvolution \\n\\n256x256 \\n\\nNeural network \\n\\n2\\n1\\n5\\nx\\n4\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n\\n2\\nx\\n2\\n1\\n5\\n\\n4\\n2\\n0\\n1\\nx\\n6\\n9\\n0\\n4\\n\\n3x32x32 image \\n\\n3x32 \\n\\n32x64 \\n\\n64x128 \\n\\n128x128 \\n\\n128x256 \\n\\nFigure 33. Custom CNN model architecture \\n\\n4.1.3.  Validate the output of the CNN models \\n\\nAfter running the script, changing the hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size and epochs) \\nthat provide the relatively best results, the output of the models is evaluated from validation \\naccuracy graph, and validation and training loss graphs. These two graphs indicate the trend of \\nthe validation accuracy and the loss along each epoch, reflecting if there is any anomaly in the \\ntraining stage of the models. Furthermore, it helps to identify if there is a possible overfitting \\nin the training and other hyperparameters should be selected.  \\n\\nOne  common  feature  of  all  validation  accuracy  graph  Figure  34  (left)  and  the  training  and \\nvalidation loss graph Figure 34 (right), for instance, is the noise that is observed as the number \\nof  epochs  increases.  Such  noises  are  common  when  the  training  dataset  is  limited  in  size. \\nTherefore, to smooth out the graphs, either large amount of training dataset should be used, or \\na  deep  data  science  technique  called  transfer  learning  should  be  adopted.  Nevertheless,  the \\npresence of the noise in those graphs does not affect the accuracy and prediction performance \\nof the models.  \\n\\n40 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\ni. \\n\\nCNN for corrosion \\n\\nFigure 34.

Evaluating the performance of the CNN models \\n\\nAll  CNN  models  were  evaluated  against  the  testing  dataset  to  validate  the  outputs  of  the \\nmodels. To better arrive at the performance that best captures the feature of the steel structure \\n\\n43 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nimages  and  classify  the  images  for  the  intended  task,  the  performance  of  each  model  is \\nevaluated.  The  commonly  used  performance  evaluation  indicators  are  accuracy,  precision, \\nrecall, specificity, and F1-score. Accordingly, based on the true label and the predicted label of \\nthe testing dataset, each image is classified into four types: true positive (TP), false positive \\n(FP),  true  negative  (TN)  and  false  negative  (FN).  Then,  the  accuracy,  precision,  recall, \\nspecificity, and F1-score are calculated as follows:  \\n\\n𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =  \\n\\n𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁\\n𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑁\\n\\n𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =  \\n\\n𝑇𝑃\\n𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃\\n\\n𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =  \\n\\n𝑇𝑃\\n𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 \\n\\n𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =  \\n\\n𝑇𝑁\\n𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃\\n\\n𝐹1 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 2 ∗  \\n\\n𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  ∗ 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙\\n𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙\\n\\nEq 1 \\n\\nEq 2 \\n\\nEq 3 \\n\\nEq 4 \\n\\nEq 5 \\n\\nTo  better  visualize  these  four  categories,  a  confusion  matrix  is  developed  for  each  CNN \\nmodels. Confusion matrix or error matrix is a technique for summarizing the performance of a \\nclassification algorithm. In most cases, using classification accuracy alone can be misleading \\nif  there  is  data  imbalance  in  each  class  of  the  training  and  testing  dataset.  Therefore,  the \\nconfusion matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the \\ninstances in a predicted class, or vice versa, as it is shown in (Table 5). \\n\\nTable 5. Confusion matrix for binary classification model \\n\\nPredicted –  Predicted + \\n\\nActual – \\nActual + \\n\\nTN \\nFN \\n\\nFP \\nTP \\n\\nAccordingly, the confusion matrix of the CNN corrosion model is reported in (Figure 40). The \\nCNN corrosion model is tested with 54 images and 45 out of 54 images are correctly predicted. \\nSimilarly, the matrix shows 20 of actually ‘corroded’ images are predicted as ‘corroded’ and 9 \\n‘not corroded’ images are predicted as ‘corroded’.

This is mainly due to the limited number of \\nimage dataset that are used to train and test the models. Therefore, the accuracy and F1 score \\nof the models can be enhanced if more image data, that reflect variable real case scenario, are \\nused. Additionally, different data science techniques, for instance the transfer learning from the \\nwell-known  pre-trained  CNN  architectures  such  as  ResNet  (He  et  al.,  2016),  AlexNet \\n(Krizhevsky et al., 2017), and VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) is proposed. \\n\\n4.2. Defining the weights of the parameters \\n\\nProportioning the weights of each parameter helps to set a threshold value that determine if a \\ngiven criteria, whether logistic, structural, or environmental analysis, is satisfied or not. Again, \\nthis threshold value is dependent on the project scale and the importance of each criterion from \\nthe others. The structural performance of the elements, in most cases, is an important factor to \\nreuse the structural elements more reliability. Similarly, the environmental impact is another \\ndeciding  factor  to  reuse  an  element  or  not.  In  this  case,  the  reuse  expert  may  set  a  higher \\nthreshold value for this criterion accordingly. \\n\\nConclusively, the following subsections summarize the parameters under each criterion with \\ntheir respective assigned weights, based on the authors personal reuse experience and expert \\narea.  Moreover,  a  tentative  threshold  value  is  set  for  each  criterion  to  assess  whether  the \\ncriterion under consideration is satisfied or not. This ultimately decides which criteria in the \\ndecision-making framework should be considered next. \\n\\nThe weights of the parameters in following tables reflect the importance of each parameter in \\nthe overall criteria performance evaluation. Accordingly, parameters with higher importance \\nare set to have higher score in the scale 0 to 4. Scale 0 representing no relevance and scale 4 \\nbeing  an  important  factor.  After  the  weight  of  each  parameter  is  assigned  individually,  the \\ncriteria performance is evaluated considering the weighted average of all parameters.  \\n\\n46 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\n4.2.1.

As  a  result,  the  answer  of  this \\nparameter,  formalized  as  binary  yes/no  question,  can \\ngreatly affect the willingness of the decision-makers to \\ndismantle and reuse the elements. \\n\\n(deconstruction, \\n\\nsorting, \\n\\n47 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nSpecial protection for \\ntransportation of the element? \\n\\nSome of the structural elements may require having a \\nspecial protection during transportation, depending on \\nthe fragility of the element. \\n\\nDismantle phase is compatible \\nwith demolition work? \\n\\nAvailability of storage? \\n\\nThreshold value \\n\\nExtracting reusable structural elements from the entire \\nset of structural frames is not always easy. For this, the \\nelement  should  be  dismantled  without  altering  its \\nmechanical  performance  and  aesthetic  aspects. \\nFurthermore, \\nthe  dismantling  process  should  be \\ntechnically feasible, and the structural elements should \\nbe easily and safely accessible. As a result, under the \\nreuse evaluation procedure, it is important to assess if \\ndismantling  of  the  elements  is  compatible  with  the \\ndemolition  work,  and  this  directly  affect  the  time \\nrequired to project time schedule. \\n\\nAvailability  of  storage  may  be  an  important  factor \\nwhen the amount of reuse elements is in larger quantity \\nand/or  volume,  and  especially  when  the  reclaimed \\nelements are collected from another site. \\n\\nThis  threshold  value,  for  this  specific  criterion  for \\ninstance, specifies how much of the above-mentioned \\nparameters  should  be  satisfied  (in  percentage)  to \\nproceed  to  the  image  classification  evaluation.  The \\nthreshold value is indeed project dependent and can be \\nset  differently  from  project  to  project.  However,  the \\nfinal value is a general indicator either to proceed to the \\nother  evaluation  criteria  or  to  start  looking  for \\nalternative means to improve the logistic feasibility. \\n\\n4.2.2.

For this, a \\nfuzzy variable is selected to linearly assign a value that \\nreflect  the  proportion  of  the  bolted  and  welded \\nconnections.  The  fuzzy  logic  considers  a  possible \\ncombination  of  bolted  and  welded  connections  in  a \\ngiven structure, and consequently apply the scale factor \\nin (Table 10) to adjust the result of the performance. \\n\\nTable 10.

Part of the analysis is \\ndone using an automated CNN tool from steel structure \\nimages data. Given the level of the accuracy of the tool \\nto predict the corrosion level of the steel elements, this \\nparameter can have medium to high importance to the \\nreusability  analysis.  Therefore,  the  weight  of  this \\nparameter should consider the correlation between the \\ncorrosion and the reusability of the element.  \\n\\nDamaged and/or distorted structural elements, whether \\ncorroded  or  not,  are  evaluated  here  and  put  into  the \\nevaluation, similarly as the corrosion case. A separate \\nCNN model is developed to analyse the damage level \\nof  the  elements  from  steel  structures  image,  and  the \\nthe \\nsame  consideration  should  be  made  when \\nappropriate weight is assigned.  \\n\\nSome assemblages are almost impossible to dismantle \\nproperly.  As  a  result,  some  construction  connections \\ncan be unsuitable to dismantle or complicated to reuse. \\nIt is thus essential to remain alert and exercise caution \\nwhile  investigating  these  types  of  connections  in  the \\nelements.  For  instance,  some  buildings  may  have  a \\nspecial  connection  between  steel  and  concrete \\nelements, and this significantly affect the dismantling \\n\\n49 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nprocess given the time and energy required to dismantle \\nthe necessary element. \\n\\nThis tells how much of the potential reusable element \\nis available on site or can be collected from the end-of-\\nlife  building.

Environmental impact assessment \\n\\nDepending  on  the  available  data,  the  embodied  carbon  of  the  reusable  elements  can  be \\ncomputed  and  compared  with  that  of  the  newly  manufactured  one.  For  this,  the  embodied \\ncarbon emissions of the structural elements should be computed for the whole life cycle from \\nproduct (A) to beyond (D) stages. \\n\\nIn  this  thesis,  a  simplified  cradle-to-cradle  life  cycle  assessment  technique  is  employed  to \\nestimate the embodied carbon of the reusable structural elements. The embodied carbon, as a \\nresult, can be computed as (Eq. 6). \\n\\n𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒) = 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑘𝑔) × 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒/𝑘𝑔) \\n\\nEq. 6 \\n\\nCarbon factors used in this tool are extracted from the guide “How to compute the embodied \\ncarbon” (Institution of Structural Engineers, 2020) and are shown in (Table 13). \\n\\nTable 13.

This quantification helps the user to evaluate the environmental \\nimpact of different reuse alternatives, but it does not affect the decision of the framework.  \\n\\n51 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\n4.2.5.

Evaluation of criteria performance \\n\\nAfter the appropriate weights of each parameter are defined, the simplest procedure to evaluate \\nthe criteria performance is to combine the contribution of the parameters for the overall benefit \\nor  feasibility  analysis.

Interactive user dashboard for reusability analysis \\n\\nAfter  the  weight  of  the  parameters  are  properly  defined  and  the  evaluation  of  the  criteria \\nperformance  is  formulated,  a  web-based  interactive  user  dashboard  has  been  built  using \\nStreamlit (Streamlit, 2022) to facilitate user interaction as shown in (Figure 43). This dashboard \\nallows  the  user,  from  building  owners  to  professional  reuse  expert,  to  input  required \\ninformation about the existing building and the project that are necessary into the reusability \\nanalysis.  \\n\\nFigure 43. User dashboard of the decision-making framework \\n\\nAdditionally,  the  user  is  provided  with  the  option  to  upload  structural  steel  images  on  the \\ndashboard and visualize the predicted value of the images from the CNN models (Figure 44). \\nOn the other hand, it is seldom expected that reuse experts or users may not have an image data \\nof the reuse project that they want to analyse. In this regard, the level of corrosion, the overall \\ndistribution  of  the  connection  types,  and  the  damage  level  can  be  analysed  through  the \\ninformation  that  the  user  is  expected  to  input.  To  accommodate  this  scenario,  the  user \\ndashboard also gives the option to the user, if they have image data or not.  \\n\\n53 \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\x0cImplementation of the decision-making framework \\n\\nFigure 44.

CASE STUDY AND BENCHMARK VALIDATION \\n\\nIn this chapter, our decision-making framework is applied on a case study building in Romania. \\nThis case study is selected from large scale reuse research project (PROGRESS, 2020). The \\ngoal  of  this  benchmark  validation  is  to  explore  different  options  that  the  decision-makers, \\nstakeholders, and building owners have at the end-of-life scenario of an existing steel frame \\nbuilding,  starting  from  the  complete  building  adaptation  to  reusing  individual  structural \\nelements. \\n\\nThis case study validates and demonstrates the potential of our decision-making framework. \\nHowever,  no  structural  images  were  collected  to  test  the  image  classification  task  of  the \\nframework. Rather, the information related to the structural visual inspection assessment are \\ndirectly input by the user. This scenario, on the other hand, also helped to add a feature on our \\ninteractive  user  dashboard  to  alternatively  accept  related  information  in  cases  where  no \\nstructural images is found.  \\n\\nThis building was assessed as a case study for the reusability indicator method developed by \\n(Hradil et al., 2017). The reusability indicator method was developed as part of the progress \\nproject,  where the  authors identified  eight parameters to  evaluate the  reusability factor of  a \\nsteel-frame buildings. The parameters used to evaluate the reusability factor are deconstruction \\nand  disassembly,  handling  manipulation,  separation  cleaning,  redesigning,  suitability  for \\nanother purpose, modification, quality check and geometry check.  \\n\\nCompared to our methodology of this research work, (Hradil et al., 2017) considered handful \\nparameters to evaluate the reusability indicator of the steel-frame building. This research, on \\nthe other hand, has extended the number of relevant parameters categorized under five main \\ncriteria  and  an  automated  structural  image  classification  CNN  tool  is  incorporated  to  our \\ndecision-making framework.     \\n\\nThe same building is used for this case study and benchmark validation of our decision-making \\nframework and the output is compared with that of the reusability indicator method of (Hradil \\net  al.,  2017).  The  case  study  building  consists  of  production  facility  and  office  combo  that \\nshares concrete foundation but have independent superstructure (Figure 45). The single-story \\npart of the building (4.1 m height) has a width of 2×20 = 40 m from two-span frames with an \\noverall length of 9×5 = 45 m. The regularity of the steel structure is high, only disrupted by the \\npresence  of  longitudinal  purlins  and  bracing  in  the  roof  and  walls.  The  office  part  of  the \\nbuilding, on the other hand, is higher (6.1 m), having a width of 40 m and length of 3×5 = 15m. \\nMoreover, the independent columns at the interface of the two structures make it possible for \\nseparate demolition and reuse of the two sections.  \\n\\n55 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Case study and benchmark validation  \\n\\nFigure 45. Load bearing structure layout of the case study building in Romania (Hradil et al., 2017) \\n\\nOne part of the office area is divided by an intermediate floor which was designed as steel grid \\nwith  secondary  beam  and  corrugated  sheet.  A  layer  of  concrete  was  casted  on  top  of  the \\ncorrugated sheet to save up material consumption. However, this makes the disassembly of the \\ncomposite floor beams difficult.  \\n\\n5.1. Reusability analysis from our decision-making framework \\n\\nA building  comprises both  off-site and on-site produced components,  connected  and joined \\ntogether through various techniques and materials. This  complexity naturally influences the \\nreuse potential of a building and its components (Hradil et al., 2017).  \\n\\nThe case study building is mainly composed of primary structures, components of the primary \\nstructures, and individual elements (Figure 46). To better analyse the alternative possibilities \\nand  reuse  as  much  of  the  building  elements,  the  reusability  analysis  is  divided  into  three \\nscenarios that reflect reuse of structural elements at different scale of complexity, ranging from \\nreuse of the entire building (adaptation) to reuse of individual structural elements.  \\n\\nFigure 46. Structural components (a) rafters (b) columns (Hradil et al., 2017) \\n\\n•  Scenario 1: Reuse/adapt the whole building \\n\\nAt the building level, the whole building structure is considered for reuse. This is ideal when \\nthe  building  is  intended  for  on-site  adaptive  reuse  or  reuse  the  whole  building  for  another \\npurpose. \\n\\n56 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Case study and benchmark validation  \\n\\n•  Scenario 2: Reuse the structural components \\n\\nPortal  frames  containing  individual  structural  elements  can  be  reused  as  a  component, \\nespecially when the structure is intended to be supplemented with additional components or \\npart of a new or existing building. \\n\\n•  Scenario 3: Reuse individual structural elements \\n\\nIndividual  columns,  beams  and  purlins  fall  under  this  category.  In  cases  where  the  set  of \\ncomponents are not suitable for components reuse, the individual structural elements can be \\ndismantled and reused individually. That said, a representative element can be selected for a \\ngroup of structural elements with same cross-sections and lengths. In this case, it is assumed \\nthat the cross-sections will be reused somewhere else or sold to various material dealers and \\nend users. \\n\\nAccordingly,  the  detailed  information  collected  from  the  project  for  each  scenario  is \\nsummarized in (Table 15, Table 16, and Table 17). Depending on the outcome of our decision-\\nmaking framework, the end user or the building owner can decide to adapt the whole building, \\nreuse  part  of  the  components,  or  individual  elements.  In  the  worst-case  scenario,  where  all \\nparameters  that  facilitate  the  reusability  of  an  element  are  not  fulfilled,  demolition  and \\nrecycling would be the alternative outcome. \\n\\nPart  of  the  information  about  the  project  are  referred  from  (Hradil  et  al.,  2017).  Given  the \\nlimited number of parameters that the original authors considered for their evaluation, it was \\nnot possible to collect the whole information for our decision-making framework as well as \\nCNN  evaluation  tool.  Therefore,  some  missing  information  are  either  assumed  or  left \\nincomplete in this case.  \\n\\ni. \\n\\nLogistic feasibility \\n\\nTable 15.

General decision outcome for scenario 3 \\n\\nThe outcome of our decision-making framework indicates that reuse is the potential alternative \\nfor scenario 3 – reuse individual structural element. The outcome of our decision-making tool \\nfor logistic feasibility and structural performance has similar percentage to what the reusability \\nindicator method shows in the study of (Hradil et al., 2017). The percentage difference between \\nthe two analysis is attributed to the number of the parameters that are taken into account and \\n\\n60 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Case study and benchmark validation  \\n\\nthe distribution of the weights of the parameters. The possible reason why the reuse rate for \\nscenario 3 from our decision-making framework is higher is the case study building has been \\nconsidered for more parameters here and as well, fulfilled majority of the criteria for reuse.  \\n\\nTherefore, in both cases, the user or the decision-maker has the three proven alternatives when \\nit comes to an efficient end-of-life scenario of the existing steel frame structure.

Result of the embodied carbon computation of the structural components \\n\\nGiven  the  simplified  cradle-to-cradle  LCA  computation  method  adopted  in  our  decision-\\nmaking framework (section 4.2.4), the total weight of the potential reusable structural elements \\nis  input  as  a  bulk  weight,  and  the  embodied  carbon  is  computed.  The  total  weight  of  the \\nstructural elements is 94.3 ton. Depending on the final decision of the user, different percentage \\n\\n61 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Case study and benchmark validation  \\n\\nof the structural elements could be reused. As a result, the embodied carbon for the production \\nstage (A1 – A3) is computed for three different reuse percentages and the amount of CO2 that \\ncan be saved from this decision is reported in (Table 20).  \\n\\nTable 20.

For \\nthis specific case study, depending on the amount of the reuse percentage, 53,000 – 106,000 \\nkgCO2e can be saved, if 50% – 100% of all the structural elements are reused, respectively. \\n\\n5.5. Conclusion of the case study analysis \\n\\nIn this chapter, the reusability analysis of a case study building is performed with our decision-\\nmaking  framework  that  is  developed  in  this  thesis  work.  The  reusability  analysis  evaluates \\nthree possible scenarios from which the estimation of the reusability of individual structural \\nelements,  structural  components  and/or  the  whole  building  is  presented.  Comparison  of  the \\ndifferent reuse scenarios shows that reusing only parts of steel elements might not be always \\nthe best solution for the whole structure. Furthermore, The LCA study of the reuse scenarios \\ndemonstrates the use of the reusability analysis in predicting the life-cycle impacts, and clearly \\nshow that significant reduction of environmental impact achieved with reuse.  \\n\\nThis  case  study  also  showed  the  capability  of  our  decision-making  framework  to  analyse \\ndifferent scenarios and various input information from the user. The framework can be more \\naccommodating if it has the option to accept missing information, and the default value of the \\nparameters should consider this fact. Furthermore, some information may not necessarily have \\na definite binary yes/no answer. For instance, the structural components in the case study have \\nlimited use as horizontal beams, considering the possibility to reuse them as a unique purpose. \\nIn this case, more select options should be given the user and similarly, the user is advised to \\ntake individual experience-based judgment in performing the analysis.  \\n\\nFor this  specific case study and benchmark  validation chapter, it was not  possible to  find a \\ncomplete project that comprises both steel structure images data and technical specifications. \\nThe case studies available at hand have a limited set of images from the project, however, do \\nnot have sufficient detail to validate the output of the CNN models. For instance, the images \\nare completely coated to tell whether the structural elements are damaged or not. Furthermore, \\nsome of the images are taken from far distance that it is difficult to tell whether the connection \\ntype is bolted or welded, even for the annotator. Therefore, our decision-making framework \\nthat is developed in this thesis is validated with the considered case study in this chapter.\\n\\n62 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Conclusion  \\n\\n6.  CONCLUSION \\n\\nReuse is essential in reducing the significant embodied carbon emission, the highest resource \\nconsumption, and the demolition-related waste of the construction industry. Reusing structural \\nelements  keeps  materials  and  components  in  the  circular  loop  in  the  built  environment, \\nfacilitating the circular economy principle. \\n\\nThis  research  has  been  designed  and  developed  considering  the  significant  environmental \\nimpact  of  reuse,  and  the  emergence  of  advanced  digital  technologies,  coupled  with  the \\ninitiatives  and  directions  proposed  by  European  frameworks.  The  aim  of  this  thesis  is  to \\nfacilitate the reuse of structural elements and components in buildings and help to establish a \\ncircular economy in the built environment. \\n\\nTo  address  the  aim  of  the  thesis,  a  general  multi-criteria  decision-making  framework  is \\nproposed, refined, and developed consulting the state-of-the-art review, practical experience, \\nand expertise area of the authors. This framework evaluates the reuse potential of structural \\nelements  from  logistics  feasibility,  structural  visual  inspection,  structural  performance, \\nenvironmental impact, and economic analysis point of view. The structural visual inspection is \\nautomated  with  convolutional  neural  network  tool  that  recognizes  the  corrosion  level,  the \\nconnection  type,  and  the  associated  damages  from  steel  structure  images,  with  an  overall \\naccuracy of 83%, 89%, and 83%, respectively.  \\n\\nThe  decision-making  framework  is  validated  on  a  real-world  steel  frame  reuse  project  and \\ndemonstrated  that  reuse  is  the  most  efficient  and  feasible  alternative  for  the  end-of-life \\nbuilding.  Moreover,  for  this  specific  case  study,  depending  on  the  amount  of  the  reuse \\npercentage, 53,000 – 106,000 kgCO2e can be saved, if 50% – 100% of the structural elements \\nare reused, respectively. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the following points are addressed regarding the benefits of the tool: \\n\\n•  Reusability analysis of multiple scenarios: the reusability analysis evaluates the reuse \\npotential of different scenarios, and the ultimate suggestion of the reusability analysis \\nhelps to have an efficient choice of end-of-life scenario of steel structures.  \\n\\n•  Automated  image  classification  tool:  part  of  the  preliminary  structural  inspection \\nprocedure of reusability analysis is supplemented with an automated CNN based tool \\nthat classifies images based on the corrosion level, the connection type and associated \\ndamage. \\n\\n•  Embodied  GHG  emissions  assessment:  the  embodied  carbon  assessment  of  the \\nalternative scenarios is computed to help evaluate the environmental impact of the reuse \\nscenarios. The tool can give the users information of life cycle modules in the product \\nstage (A1 – A3), end-of-life stage (C1 – C4) and at reuse/recycle and recovery stage \\n(D). This makes the calculation more transparent, understandable, and comparable, and \\nit enables the users to maintain a straightforward way of calculating the environmental \\nimpact parameters. \\n\\n63 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Conclusion  \\n\\n•  Interactive user dashboard: the users of the tool can interact with the decision-making \\ntool by providing necessary information and uploading steel structure images for the \\nreusability analysis. This informative, easy-to-use, and low-cost, web-based dashboard \\nhelp the users understand how the framework function in a transparent way.  \\n\\nThe  general  decision-making  framework  ultimately  contributes  to  the  need  to  develop  an \\ninterdisciplinary tool that facilitate the reuse practice in the built environment, so that decision-\\nmakers, reuse experts and building owners can reduce the risk and uncertainties associated with \\nreusing  structural  elements.  Moreover,  it  reflects  the  benefits  and  potential  of  adopting \\nadvanced  digital  technologies  to  help  the  digital  innovation  and  transformation  of  the  built \\nenvironment,  which  will  in  turn,  help  achieve  the  sustainability  goals  aimed  by  the  AEC \\nindustry. \\n\\nFuture works \\n\\nThe  limitations  associated  with  interpreting  the  results,  as  well  as  their  generalization  and \\napplication  is  summarized  as  follows.  Moreover,  starting  from  the  limitations,  the  authors \\npropose  the  following  improvements  in  future  endeavours  to  improve  the  robustness  of  the \\ngeneral decision-making framework. \\n\\no  The decision-making framework is developed mainly for steel structures. However, the \\nmethodology can be extended for other structures as well. Therefore, future works can \\nbe done to incorporate the reuse practice of different construction materials such as pre-\\ncast concrete and timber structures.  \\n\\no  The  decision-making  framework  focuses  mainly  on  the  structural  elements  and \\ncomponents comprised in the superstructure. However, the overall practice of reusing \\nsubstructure elements should also be studied and can be added to the framework. \\n\\no  The  CNN  models  are  trained  with  limited  number  of  steel  structure  images.  The \\naccuracy of the models can be enhanced with more training images. Furthermore, in \\nfuture  experiments,  a  CNN  detections  algorithm  with  scene  segmentation  labelling \\nshould be employed to better localize and classify the corroded section of the individual \\nelements, the connection types, and the damage levels. \\n\\no  Given the wide practice of building information models and digital twin applications in \\nthe built environment, the reusability analysis and the decision-making framework can \\nbe  extended  to  these  technologies  to  push  reuse  applications  further  in  the  built \\nenvironment. Moreover, advanced scan2BIM techniques such as LiDAR scanning, 3D \\npoint cloud datasets, an open-source 3D models from Google Earth and Google Maps \\ncould be utilized to pipeline the input of information and data. \\n\\n64 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c                      Conclusion  \\n\\no  Further  research  focused  on  the  applicability  of  deep  CNN  classification  using \\nalternative  materials  and  structures  would  enhance  accuracy  in  less  than  perfect \\nconditions. Furthermore, research on the use of deep CNN associated with real time \\nvideo streaming, drone images, robotics, digital twins could bring the built environment \\none  step  closer  to  fully  automate  the  structural  visual  inspections  in  the  built \\nenvironment. \\n\\no  Using  high  level  LCA  computation  software  to  compute  the  environmental  impact \\nassessment for different reuse scenarios is advisable. In depth computation of LCA is \\npossible  with  an  API  integration  of  other  software  such  as  OpenLCA  together  with \\nexisting database for steel production, transport, and waste processing. \\n\\no  In this research, an extensive effort is made to define the appropriate weights of the \\nparameters. Given the developed framework, a future work could be to train a neural \\nnetwork  using  several  case  studies  and  previous  project  databases,  to  optimize  the \\nweights of the parameters as well as build a robust reusability evaluation network. \\n\\no  Deconstruction and dismantling process usually incur additional cost in comparison to \\ndemolition.  Therefore,  an  advanced  economic  evaluation  tools  can  be  developed  to \\ncompute  the  cost  benefit  assessment  of  reuse  procedures  and  incorporated  to  the \\ndecision-making framework.   \\n\\n65 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cBibliography \\n\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \\n\\nAdedeji, O., & Wang, Z.

This huge building was over 330 meters long, 39 meters high and \\nhad a width of 70 meters incorporating over 20,000 tonnes of structural steelwork. Given its \\nvolume  and  large  column-free  spaces,  it  was  converted  to  a  material  storage  facility  after \\ntwenty years of production. In 2004, the building had come to the end of its useful life, and it \\nwas marked for demolition.  \\n\\nThe decision for demolition was made due to three inhibiting factors for reuse. These are lack \\nof safe access, due to its welded and riveted joints and the building was designed using non-\\nstandard sections. As a result, it was decided to use explosive demolition and then recycle scrap \\nsteels.  \\n\\nThe analysis results after the demolition indicate that 100% of the steel was recovered from the \\nsite and 100% was recycled. This includes the rebar in the floor construction. The concrete \\nfrom the floor construction was also crushed and used as low-grade infill material. Finally, the \\nrecycling  of  steel  from  the  Lackenby  steel  plant  saved  enough  energy  to  supply  3700 \\nhouseholds with their energy requirements for a year. The Heathrow Terminal 5, Oval Cricket \\nground, Paddington station, and Ford transit vans are among the examples where the recycled \\nsteel was used for construction.  \\n\\nScrap steel is crucial to the manufacture of new steel. Over 45% of all steel is manufactured \\ndirectly from scrap and all steel products include some recycled content. Because of this, it has \\na very high value, a fact that ensures almost all scrap steel that becomes available is collected. \\nWorldwide, it is estimated that the recovery rate is over 80%. Consequently, the scrap value is \\nenhanced because steel reaching the end of its life is 100% recyclable and the possibilities for \\nmaking new products are endless.  \\n\\nRecycling reduces waste. Given the 35% of waste in the UK accounting for the construction \\nand  demolition  waste,  recycling  diverts  waste  from  landfill  and  displaces  production  from \\nvirgin sources. This saves on raw material resources and energy also means that the emissions \\nof greenhouse gases  are  reduced. Furthermore, because of the residual value, 99% of scrap \\nderived from structural steel used in construction is either reused or recycled. The summary of \\nreuse and recycling rate of the project is presented in (Table 21). \\n\\nTable 21.

From  a  practical  point  of  view,  one  of  the  main \\nquestions from the presentation and as well from  the audience was how to reuse reinforced \\nconcrete structures (the big elephant in the room). The current practice to manage end-of-life \\nconcrete elements is to crush and use them to produce a new one. But this process still produces \\nemissions in the process. However, according to Prof. Corentin Fivet, the alternative ways to \\nreuse reinforced concrete elements are as follows.  \\n\\nThe first alternative is to extract reusable concrete elements using diamond saws and hydraulic \\njet technologies. These techniques are especially famous in demolition companies that operate \\nin dense areas where no noise and dust are required. Furthermore, in this regard, prefabricated \\nconcrete  elements  are  even  more  convenient  to  be  reused.  However,  large  proportion  of \\nReinforced Concrete (RC) structures, at least here in Europe, are cast in situ structures. \\n\\nSecondly, in reusing and repurposing existing buildings and structures, one should settle for \\nthe  idea  that  the  reuse  of  RC  elements  can  also  be  realized  through  varying  the  structural \\npurpose of the elements i.e., for instance, disassembled slab elements can be reused as walls \\nsince the strength requirement of walls is relatively lower than the slabs. Similarly, a concrete \\ncolumn  that  was  once  holding  up  a  banking  headquarters  could  become  a  pile,  a  series  of \\nbuilding blocks, or even unassuming kerbstones. \\n\\nAdditionally,  for  the  moment,  of  course  the  practical  experience  of  retrofitting  historic \\nbuildings can be extended to reuse of Reinforced Concrete elements. Using a non-destructive \\ntest could be one alternative to assess the structural elements. That said, even if reuse is highly \\nappreciated in  terms  of environmental perspective, the practical  applicability of reusing RC \\nelements  is  still  not  fully  convincing  for  the  designers,  given  the  risk  and  uncertainties \\nassociated with it. Moreover, it is also mentioned that this issue could be a possible research \\narea to facilitate reuse in the construction industry. \\n\\n75 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cAnnex III: Lessons learned from AI in AEC conference 2022 \\n\\nANNEX III: Lessons learned from AI in AEC conference 2022 \\n\\nThe AI in AEC 2022 conference was held on March 23-24, 2022, with over 230 registered \\nparticipants  from  30  countries  and  it  was  a  combination  of  keynote  sessions,  research \\npresentations, and C-suite panel discussions. \\n\\nThe  main  topics  of  this  conference  were  computational  design,  smart  buildings  and  cities, \\nsustainable  development,  automated  document  processing,  autonomous  monitoring,  and \\nconstruction management (Figure 51). \\n\\nFigure 51. General information about AI in AEC conference 2022 \\n\\nThe AEC industry is fragmented with complex and challenging problems, and it is the least \\ndigitalized industry next to the agriculture industry. Therefore, it is believed that now is the \\ntime to make use of the advance technologies and methodologies that this AI era is offering us.  \\n\\nGiven the complexity and the variety of stakeholders that participate in the AEC industry, the \\nkey to success in a complex and large project environment is very often shaped by the same \\ngoal and shared responsibility. Artificial intelligence (AI) can also be a powerful tool to assist \\nin addressing these problems. Therefore, this conference aims to motivate researchers all over \\nthe world to share their ideas to make the AEC industry profitable by using AI.  \\n\\nThis thesis is selected to be presented at this AI in AEC conference (Figure 52) which belongs \\nto the \"Autonomous monitoring\" topic. The audience were curious about the research project \\nand asked what the challenges of this project was. The challenges of this project were mainly \\ngetting enough amount of data available for training and testing the machine learning models.  \\nFurthermore,  professionals  in  the  industry,  especially  structural  engineers,  are  still  not  sure \\nwhether reuse is reliable or not. Not only that, but cultural issues are also another contributing \\nfactors  to  limited  practice  of  reuse  as  the  society  in  general  believes  that  old  and  used \\nelements/products have less value than the new ones.  \\n\\n76 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cAnnex III: Lessons learned from AI in AEC conference 2022 \\n\\nThe other issue was a topic of scalability. The research work could be scaled with more image \\ndataset for training the models, and the collection of the appropriate weights of parameters can \\nenhance the robustness of the general decision-making framework.  \\n\\nAnother aspect of the benefit of reuse is related to the escalating price of construction materials. \\nReuse is both energy- and material-efficient. Therefore, there is no doubt that material reuse \\ncan  help  reduce  the  material  price,  through  a  reduction  of  material  raw-resources  and \\ndemolition-related waste. Furthermore, the practical  implementation  of the decision-making \\nframework  is  planned  in  industry  collaboration  with  real-world  reuse  companies  and  steel \\nmanufacturers.  \\n\\nFigure 52. Thesis presentation on AI in AEC conference \\n\\nOne other fascinating application of AI in steel structures was the smart design and modelling \\nof steel connections on BIM models. Effort was made to localize the connection points from \\nBIM model and were able to suggest a connection design as it is shown in the (Figure 53). In \\nthe future, a dataset of standard connection is going to be open-sourced so as to facilitate the \\ncollaboration with steel manufacturers and other fellow designers.  \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  engineers  from  RAMBOLL  were  also  able  to  design  a  complete  bridge \\nproject  autonomously.  Interestingly,  the  bridge  that  was  intended  to  be  designed  and \\nconstructed is shown in  the  (Figure  54)  and the team  was able to  adopt  the most advanced \\nstructural analysis, parametric design and computational techniques like Rhino, Grasshopper, \\nSOFiSTiK that integrated with a structural element sections database, to design the bridge in \\ncomplete autonomy. \\n\\nFurthermore,  the  team  also  produced  nearly  6000  construction  drawings  to  the  contractor \\ndeveloping an autonomous program that can primarily produce a drawing with the appropriate \\ndimensioning and the legends. Not only that, since it was demanding to check all produced \\ndrawings  of  the  project  manually,  they  also  managed  to  perform  the  drawing  checks \\nautonomously, building a program that checks the most obvious detailing requirements.  \\n\\n77 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cAnnex III: Lessons learned from AI in AEC conference 2022 \\n\\nFigure 53. Smart design and modelling of steel connections \\n\\nFigure 54. Kruunuvuori Bridge: Holistic computational design for fabrication of large scale bridge, Ramboll \\n\\nAll  in  all,  the  conference  was  full  of  interesting  research  presentations  that  highlights  the \\npossible application of advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques into \\nthe AEC industry.

Therefore, \\nreuse should be promoted for better waste management and efficient use of materials. The built \\nenvironment can take advantage of circular economy and digitalization principles to promote \\nreuse practices.

The role of structural engineers to reduce emissions and promote sustainability \\n\\nThe  pressing  challenge  of  climate  change,  carbon  emissions  and  significant  resource \\nconsumption  need  special  attention  and  unwavering  contribution  from  the  construction \\nindustry. For this, the emissions from materials and construction processes should be urgently \\naddressed to ensure that the built environment is optimized for low-carbon solutions across the \\nfull building life cycle. The reduction in embodied carbon and resource consumption, as well \\nas  other  environmental  impacts,  can  be  achieved  by  recovering  building  waste  caused  by \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntroduction \\n\\ndemolition  through  material  reuse,  recycling  or  building  repurposing  through  selective \\ndeconstruction and building system reuse (Assefa & Ambler, 2017). Moreover, case studies \\naround the world show that a significant portion of the debris can be recycled and reused during \\nthe clean-up phases to reduce the volume of the debris disposed into landfill sites and eliminates \\nsome of the need for site remediation before new construction. \\n\\nSimilarly,  the  role  of  professionals  in  the  construction  industry  is  essential.

This can be evident \\nthrough maximizing refurbishment of existing buildings, evaluating each design choice using \\na whole life-cycle approach, and seeking to minimize upfront carbon impacts. The collective \\neffort of these will in turn help avoid future embodied carbon during and at the end-of-life in \\nmaximizing the potential for renovation, future adaptation, and circularity. \\n\\nFigure 4.
