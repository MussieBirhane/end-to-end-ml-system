A complete ML pipeline is built on the Amazon SageMaker studio. The pipeline comprises data pre-processing, training and hyperparameter tuning, deploying and monitoring. 

The main difference of ML in production is all data science related jobs are now done at scale. The preprocessing done on modelling step should be done exxactly the same on the production as well. Thus, the preprocessing pipeline should be saved for future tasks on production step.
